Professor Anthony J. Richardson leads a dynamic and collaborative research group dedicated to using mathematical and computational tools to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the ocean. His lab focuses on developing models to understand how to conserve marine biodiversity, predict and manage impacts of climate change, and understand the role of plankton in the ocean. He has [authored >250 scientific papers and been cited >35,000 times](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=RLeJq98AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

The Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab is known for its supportive and collegial atmosphere, with a critical mass of researchers who share a passion for solving real-world ecological problems through quantitative approaches. Lab members benefit from a culture of curiosity, collaboration and innovation, and are encouraged to explore ideas at the interface of conservation, ecology and data science.

If you want to have impact and have a strong quantitative background or are keen to build those skills, then this could be the perfect lab for you. We welcome students and early-career researchers from a wide range of disciplines—including conservation, ecology, mathematics, statistics and computer science—to get in touch and discuss opportunities to work together.

Outside the lab, Anthony enjoys long-distance cycling and is an avid traveller. He has a love for African wildlife, and can often be found exploring game reserves during his holidays.

Jason is a biological oceanographer, with an interest in how oceanographic processes structure planktonic ecosystems.

His research has focused on how flow regimes, boundary currents, eddies and upwelling events drive changes in the biomass, species distribution and size structure of zooplankton communities. In addition, he have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.

Jason's current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries.

Kieran is a quantitative ecologist specialising in macroecological processes, with a focus on understanding the impacts of climate change and fishing on marine ecosystems. Through his research, he aims to contribute to the development of solutions for sustainable life on Earth.

Kieran is currently working on the Australian Research Council Discovery Project "Zooplankton: the missing link in modelling the ocean carbon cycle," leading the continued development of the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra (ZooMSS). His work focuses on enhancing modelling of fish groups, incorporating fishing impacts into ZooMSS, temperature sensitivity of physiological processes, and the mesopelagic realm.

His research expertise lies in size-structured food web modeling, which he has used to explore cephalopod ecology and trait-based representation in ecosystem models. During his PhD, Kieran investigated how functional traits explain trophic allometries of cephalopods and demonstrated that incorporating greater biological realism into size-based feeding relationships can significantly impact ecosystem structure and stability.

Kieran is also involved in east Antarctic regional modeling at UTAS and is an active member of FishMIP (Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project), where he currently leads a Southern Ocean-focused working group.

Sharad is a marine biologist who has joined the School of Environment as a PhD candidate. He comes from India, where he was engaged in several marine and wildlife research projects, after completing his master’s in marine biology. He also holds a post-graduate diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS. Back in India, he conducted research at the Wildlife Institute of India, in understanding the spatial ecology of Dugongs, mangroves succession in the Nicobar group of islands after the tsunami of 2004, and coral reef biodiversity assessment of Malvan Marine Sanctuary, along the west coast of India. He has previously worked at the Horniman Museum, London as a visiting researcher, to conduct research on coral reproductive biology and restoration practices. Lately, at Wildlife Conservation Society-India, he was involved in developing data-driven strategies for management practices of Marine Protected Areas along the west coast of India, before moving to Brisbane. For his PhD, he will pursue the implications of climate-driven risks on the biodiversity dynamics under the project “Portfolio projection of biodiversity responses under climate change”. The project aims to quantify adaptive and migration responses as vulnerability metrics, providing resource managers with novel tools to formulate flexible management strategies.

Alice is a final-year PhD student with a supervisory team spanning the University of the Sunshine Coast and the University of Queensland. Her research uses CMIP6 climate projections up to 2100 to: (1) identify climate refugia across various exposure metrics within Australia’s existing marine protected area (MPA) network; (2) assess the climate connectivity of existing MPAs using climate velocity trajectories; and (3) incorporate these layers into a spatial prioritisation to explore alternative MPA configurations that may be more robust to long-term climate impacts. An interloper from NSW, Alice has a past life in fisheries science, having previously developed Ecological Risk Assessments and contributed to Stock Assessments for both NSW and QLD commercial fisheries. She is pursuing post-doc opportunities, and is particularly interested in long-term approaches to marine conservation, quantitative marine ecology, data visualisation, and functional programming.
