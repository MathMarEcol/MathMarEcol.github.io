    "text": "As an academic researcher, scientist, or basically anyone working with a computer, it’s essential to have an online presence. With the rise of the internet, having a personal website has become more critical than ever. A personal website serves as a platform to showcase your research work, achievements, and credentials to a global audience. It’s a professional tool that helps you stand out in a crowded digital world and reach a wider audience. In this tutorial, we will be exploring the steps involved in creating a personal website that accurately reflects your identity. From choosing the right tools all the way to publishing your website on the internet, this post will cover everything you need to know to create a successful and effective personal website. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you achieve your online goals and reach a new level of discoverability.\nThe internet is full of tools to build a website, and their sheer amount can be overwhelming. WordPress is a great no-code tool, but its visual editor has driven me nuts when I used it in the past to do client work as a freelance web designer. I personally prefer code-based tools because they give me full control and reproducibility. But even within the realm of code-based web design, there are more tools than a single person could ever try out. In this blog post, we will talk about how to set up your personal website with Quarto."

The YAML format is a compromise between a machine-readable and a human-readable file. The good news is: You don’t have to write new YAML blocks; you just have to enter some info in the appropriate places. Let’s go through the _quarto.yml file step by step.\n\n2.4.1 Author info\nIt’s time to tell the readers about yourself. Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.4.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.4.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.4.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive? The official Quarto Documentation contains a bunch of other settings you can tweak via the _quarto.yml configuration. Happy hacking. Please submit a PR or raise an issue if you find something interesting that we all should know about."

This is the first impression that visitors have from your website. It is a great opportunity to tell them a bit about yourself and spark their interest.\nIn this template, we are not designing a full landing page from scratch. Instead, we use one of the great template designs that are shipped with Quarto. Template inception.\nOpen the /index.qmd file and inspect the header, that is, the part at the top of the source code which is enclosed in --- delimiters:\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n---\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  id: about-block\n  image: img/my_image.png\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/WhoUsesTwitterAnymore\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/MathMarEcol\n    - icon: linkedin\n      text: LinkedIn\n      href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/WeDontHaveAnAccount\n    - icon: envelope\n      text: Email\n      href: \"mailto:a.richardson1@uq.edu.au\"\n---\n\nAll following fields are nested in the about field, which is our way of telling Quarto that all the subsequent information should be associated with our “About” section. The template is called jolla, and you can find other options here. The id field assigns a name to the “About” section such that you can insert it anywhere in your page. As the name might suggest, the image field contains the path of an image to display on your landing page. Finally, the links field contains a bunch of social links. Each social entry consists of three fields:\n\nicon: identifier of an icon, such as twitter or envelope. You can take a look at the Standard Bootstrap5 Icons for more icon names.\ntext: description of the entry, usually for accessibility\nhref: link, make sure to add mailto: before an email address\n\nAs you can see in the /index.qmd file, the “About” block is inserted in the actual document via\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n::: {#about-block}\n:::\n\nand you can add a nice introduction about yourself below the block."

This has one subtle advantage over creating mypage.qmd in the base directory. If you created /mypage.qmd, the URL would be www.yourname.com/mypage.html. That exposed .html in the URL looks very 2010. Instead, you should go with /mypage/index.qmd and get the modern-looking URL www.yourname.com/mypage.\n!Avoid .html in your URL by using a subfolder with index.html.\nOnce you have created your brand-new index.qmd, just copy the code skeleton of any other index.qmd from the template and start adding your content. If you wish to, add the newly created page to the navigation (see Section 2.4.2). That’s it, you have successfully extended your website 🚀"

    "section": "3.1 Preparing your website for GitHub pages",
    "text": "3.1 Preparing your website for GitHub pages\nThe template already contains all necessary settings for GitHub pages, so you don’t have to do anything in this section. However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly straightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit the &lt;github username&gt;.github.io to Github, which includes the docs/ folder, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

It is important that you follow this pattern, because &lt;github username&gt;.github.io is the only repository that will be hosted directly to the URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io.\nOn the GitHub repository, go to Settings and click on GitHub Pages. Make sure that GitHub pages will deploy from a branch (1), the branch is set to main or master (2), and GitHub Pages is served from the docs/ folder (3):\n!GitHub pages deploys from a branch (1), the branch is set to main or master (2), and it serves from the docs/ folder\nGo back to the repository and you’ll see a brown dot indicating that a build is in progress. This can take a couple of minutes. Once the deploy is done, the indicator dot will turn green. That’s it. Congratulations, your website is now live at &lt;github username&gt;.github.io! 🎈🥂🥳"

    "section": "5.1 General web development tips",
    "text": "5.1 General web development tips\nHere are some general web development tips, ranging from file management and DNS over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n5.1.1 Relative links\nSuppose you are editing the file projects/index.qmd and want to add a link to the page &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography. You can of course link to the full URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend.\n\n\n5.1.4 Add favicon"
