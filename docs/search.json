    "text": "Conservation\n\nSeamount connectivity: informing deep-sea conservation with oceanographic models\nSeamounts—underwater mountains scattered throughout the ocean—are increasingly targeted by fisheries and may soon face pressure from seabed mining. Despite their ecological significance, most lie in the high seas, where protection is limited. The recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty provides a historic opportunity to advance conservation in these regions, but actionable science is urgently needed to guide spatial planning. This PhD project will explore how the connectivity of biodiversity among seamounts—driven by deep ocean currents —can inform the design of protected area networks. While direct observations of population connectivity in the deep sea are challenging, high-resolution oceanographic models offer new opportunities to simulate larval dispersal among seamounts. The student will simulate three-dimensional dispersal of neutrally buoyant particles from selected seamounts in key regions such as the western Pacific and central Pacific. These simulations will explore horizontal and vertical connectivity, identify potential source and sink regions, assess how oceanographic isolation may drive endemism, assess model predictions against available genetic data, and explore how oceanographic connectivity may support resilient fisheries. A key focus will be designing protected area networks that incorporate seamount connectivity. This PhD is suited to a student with interests in ocean modelling, marine conservation, and spatial ecology. It will involve working with large oceanographic datasets and particle tracking simulations, and will include collaborations with deep-sea ecologists, geneticists, and policy experts. The student will gain valuable skills in oceanographic modelling, systematic conservation planning, and deep-sea ecology, contributing directly to science-policy initiatives under the BBNJ Treaty.\n\n\nHow well do marine protected areas work? Tracking biodiversity in a changing ocean\nMarine protected areas are expanding rapidly around the world, but how well do they conserve biodiversity, especially under mounting human and climate pressures? This PhD project asks whether marine species fare better inside MPAs than outside, and whether stricter levels of protection lead to stronger ecological benefits. The student will leverage several global resources - including the BIOTIMEv2 database, IUCN red list status and AquaX distribution maps - and use Generalised Linear Mixed Models to assess how trends in species differ: inside and outside MPAs; with levels of protection in MPAs; with time since MPA designation; across taxonomic groups; with human stressors; with climate exposure; and across ecological traits. Are biodiversity trends more positive in highly protected areas or where more of a species range is covered by MPAs? Do MPAs buffer against climate change impacts such as ocean warming? Are larger species more vulnerable than small ones, and are certain habitats more affected than others? This project offers an exciting opportunity for a student with strong quantitative skills to work at the science-policy interface of marine conservation. You will develop expertise in large-scale biodiversity synthesis, statistical modelling, and conservation impact evaluation—key skills for careers in ecological research, marine policy, and environmental data science.\n\n\nSmart zoning for a sustainable ocean: Optimising protected areas for biodiversity and fisheries\nAlthough conservation scientists and NGOs advocate for fully protected no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), most MPAs end up as partial-take zones that permit some fishing—often without a clear strategy to maximise biodiversity outcomes. As global efforts accelerate to meet the 30x30 target—protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030—this disconnect between conservation ideals and real-world implementation risks delivering suboptimal outcomes for both nature and people. This PhD project asks: how can we better zone the global ocean to conserve biodiversity while supporting sustainable fisheries? It will explore whether zoning for one type of fishing (e.g., pelagic) can help protect other biodiversity components (e.g., benthic habitats), and whether more realistic, explicitly multi-use planning can outperform traditional no-take-only approaches. The project includes three integrated components: (1) a global synthesis of bycatch data across fishing gears to identify biodiversity most at risk; (2) an assessment of fishing activity within existing MPAs and its biodiversity impacts; and (3) a spatial optimisation analysis to design multi-use ocean zones that maximise both conservation and fisheries benefits. This is an excellent opportunity for a student interested in marine spatial planning, conservation science, and applied ecological modelling. The work will involve global datasets, advanced geospatial and statistical tools, and contribute directly to international policy efforts under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The student will gain expertise in systematic conservation planning, biodiversity data analysis, and policy-relevant science—valuable skills for careers in research, environmental policy, or global marine conservation.\n\n\nSafeguarding ocean biodiversity: Conserving species’ niches in marine protected areas\nMarine protected areas are central to ocean conservation, but how well do they protect the full diversity of environmental conditions that species need to adapt and persist? While many MPAs aim to cover habitat areas, surprisingly little is known about whether they capture the range of environmental conditions — the realized niches — that foster local adaptations and long-term species survival. This project will tackle this gap by assessing how well existing MPAs conserve environmental heterogeneity for marine species, inspired by cutting-edge approaches recently applied to terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Hanson et al. 2020, Nature). Using climate model outputs (Earth System Models) and species distribution data from AquaX, the student will classify key environmental features, including temperature, and evaluate how well marine protected areas meet conservation targets across these gradients. Ideal candidates will have skills in or a strong interest in learning spatial analysis, ecological modelling, marine conservation, climate change science, and working with large environmental data sets. This project offers the opportunity to work at the frontier of marine conservation science, develop advanced spatial analysis skills, and contribute solutions for designing future-proof protected areas that enhance the adaptive potential of species in a changing ocean.\n\n\nBlue carbon and biodiversity: Optimising marine protected areas for climate and conservation\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are powerful tools for conserving ocean biodiversity — but can they also help protect the ocean’s critical role in carbon sequestration? Recent research (e.g., Berzaghi et al. 2023, Nature Climate Change) highlights worrying overlaps between intensive fishing activities and key areas of pelagic and benthic carbon storage, threatening the ocean’s ability to draw down and store carbon. This project will explore how to design MPA networks that simultaneously protect biodiversity and safeguard carbon sequestration processes, aiming for win–win outcomes for conservation and climate mitigation. Using spatial data on fishing effort, carbon sequestration hotspots, and biodiversity patterns, the student will analyse trade-offs and synergies to inform smarter ocean protection strategies. This project offers the opportunity to develop expertise in marine spatial planning, carbon cycle science, and geospatial analysis, and contribute to urgently needed solutions at the intersection of biodiversity and climate action. Ideal candidates will have skills or a strong interest in spatial ecology, conservation planning, carbon cycle science, working with geospatial data, and/or ocean sustainability.\n\n\nProtecting Marine Biodiversity: Are We Covering Enough? (Honours or MSc project)\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a cornerstone of ocean conservation, but how well do they represent the full diversity of marine life? Most species have less than 5% of their ranges protected globally, and even less for wide-ranging and tropical ones (Klein et al. 2015). This project will assess how effectively current MPAs safeguard marine species, focusing on the critical “Representation” principle of the CARE (Connected, Adequate, Representative, Efficient) framework for MPA design. You will analyse species distribution maps (AquaX) to measure the percentage of species’ ranges covered by existing MPAs, distinguishing between those with partial and full protection. You will also evaluate how at-risk species, based on IUCN Red List status, are represented in fully protected areas. Looking ahead, you will project how climate change may alter the future effectiveness of MPAs. Through this project, you will gain expertise in spatial analysis, conservation planning, biodiversity informatics, and climate change impacts — skills that are highly sought after in marine science, government agencies, and conservation NGOs. Ideal candidates will have skills or a strong interest in marine ecology, spatial ecology and conservation.\n\n\nBiodiversity vs industry: Mapping the battle for ocean space (Honours or MSc)\nAs fishing, shipping, oil, gas, and mining activities accelerate in the ocean, protecting marine biodiversity is becoming increasingly complex. High overlap between biodiversity hotspots and human uses means greater threats to species — and higher costs when trying to establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This project will map where marine species distributions and human uses collide, and where they are distinct, providing critical insight into where conservation efforts can be most effective. Using AquaX global data for over 40,000 marine species, you will assess their overlap with spatial layers representing human use, including fishing, global shipping routes, oil/gas platforms and mining leases. You will also the degree of overlap between key biodiversity areas (such as Important Marine Mammal Areas, Bird Areas, and Shark and Ray Areas) and human uses. Analyses will explore different taxonomic groups, compare patterns inside Exclusive Economic Zones and in the high seas, and identify regions of both conflict and opportunity for marine protection. Through this project, you will build strong skills in spatial analysis, conservation planning, and data synthesis — valuable for careers in marine science, environmental consulting, NGOs, or government. We are looking for a motivated student with strong quantitative skills and a keen interest in conservation and marine spatial planning; experience with GIS or coding (e.g., R, Python) would be an advantage.\n\n\nSecuring Kelp Forests: Designing a Global Conservation Network for Ecosystem Services\nKelp forests are among the most valuable and productive ecosystems on Earth, generating an estimated US$500 billion per year in ecosystem services — from supplying food, materials, and potential biofuels, to removing nitrogen, sequestering carbon, protecting coastlines, and supporting rich biodiversity. Yet, despite their ecological and economic importance, global conservation planning rarely accounts for the full range of services kelp forests provide. This project will design a global Marine Protected Area (MPA) network for kelp forests. Working with global kelp biodiversity and ecosystem service datasets and using systematic conservation planning tools, you will identify priority areas that safeguard both kelp biodiversity and critical ecosystem services. The project will generate insights urgently needed for global conservation targets. You will develop skills in spatial analysis, ecosystem service valuation and conservation planning — preparing you for future roles in academia, conservation NGOs, or environmental policy. We are looking for a student who is passionate about marine conservation, with strong quantitative skills; experience with GIS, spatial modelling, or programming (e.g., R or Python) would be an advantage."

    "text": "Modelling\n\nThe role of zooplankton in the biological pump and impacts of climate change\nDespite their small size, zooplankton play a crucial role in the carbon cycle and marine food webs. However, current models struggle to accurately represent their contribution to the carbon transfer from the surface to deeper waters. This PhD project aims to improve our understanding of the role of zooplankton in the “biological pump,” which removes carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in the deep sea, how climate change could impact this process, and what this means for fisheries. This project will advance the development of the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra (ZooMSS), a global marine ecosystem model. With better zooplankton representation in ZooMSS - particularly realistic temperature responses of different zooplankton groups and processes - this will lead to improved understanding of the biological pump and why there is high tuna biomass in nutrient-poor tropical waters. This research will provide novel insights into marine ecosystems in a warming world and improve predictions of carbon sequestration and fish stocks, both important for managing climate change and fisheries. Students with a background in marine science or environmental modelling will gain expertise in ecosystem modelling, zooplankton ecology, and climate impact assessment.\n\n\nModelling zoolankton and fisheries to understand the global carbon cycles\nUnderstanding the role of zooplankton is arguably the biggest gap in our knowledge of the ocean carbon cycle. Zooplankton constitute 40% of total marine biomass, feed on different sizes of plankton, vary by an order of magnitude in their carbon content, and have diverse roles in carbon transport across the world’s oceans. Yet these features are poorly resolved in current ecosystem models.\nYou would develop new ways of modelling zooplankton in an innovative ecosystem model – the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra (ZooMSS). You will use the model to explore present and future impacts of climate change on the global ocean’s capacity to sequester carbon and support fisheries. You would be working with a team of modellers, zooplankton ecologists, and climate change scientists.\nThis position is funded through the Australian Research Council Discovery Project Zooplankton: the missing link in modelling the ocean carbon cycle.\nThe scholarship includes: living stipend of $35,000 per annum tax free (2024 rate; indexed annually) and your tuition fees are covered.\nThis scholarship is available for Australian (or New Zealand) citizens and Australian permanent residents.\nYou will have demonstrated skills in modelling, coding experience (in any programming language), and strong written and communication skills. You do not need experience in marine ecology (although it is preferred), but you must have a keen interest to learn.\nMore information and how to apply for this position is available here\n\n\nSome like it hot: Rethinking models of zooplankton in a warming world\nDespite their pivotal role in oceanic carbon cycling, zooplankton are often oversimplified in marine ecosystem and biogeochemical models, where they are typically lumped into a few generic groups with uniform traits and temperature responses. This project challenges that paradigm by integrating the rich body of experimental data on zooplankton physiology to better represent their temperature preferences. We will quantify how different zooplankton groups vary in their temperature sensitivity—such as respiration, ingestion, growth, and faecal production—using group-specific Q10 values derived from meta-analyses of published data. These refined parameters will be incorporated into a next-generation ecosystem model to test how more realistic zooplankton dynamics affect predictions of fish biomass and carbon export under climate change. By comparing outputs from bespoke temperature parameterisations with traditional models using a uniform Q10, we aim to reveal how overlooked biological complexity can reshape our understanding of ocean futures. Students involved in this project will gain expertise in ecological modelling, meta-analysis, and climate-ecosystem interactions, contributing to a transformative shift in how zooplankton are represented in biogeochemical and ecosystem models. Ideal candidates will have a background in marine science, quantitative ecology, or biological oceanography, with strong skills in modelling and data analysis."

    "text": "Plankton\n\nTides of change: Unravelling long-term impacts of urbanisation on the ecosystem health of Moreton Bay\nAs Southeast Queensland continues to urbanise rapidly, the health of its iconic coastal ecosystems—especially Moreton Bay—is under increasing pressure. Urban expansion, evolving sewerage treatment practices, and intensifying flood events are altering the delicate balance of nutrient inputs and water quality. Yet, despite the ecological and economic importance of Moreton Bay, we still lack a clear, long-term understanding of how these stressors interact and impact ecosystem health over decades. This project leverages over 25 years of high-resolution data from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program (EHMP)—one of the world’s most comprehensive aquatic monitoring efforts. Using advanced statistical and modelling techniques, including integration with a ROMS biogeochemical model in the region, you will explore how urbanisation, wastewater management, and extreme weather events have shaped the ecological trajectory of Moreton Bay. The research will identify key drivers of change and inform future management strategies for resilient coastal ecosystems. As a student in this project, you’ll develop cutting-edge skills in time-series analysis, spatial modelling, and ecosystem forecasting. You’ll work with one of Australia’s richest environmental data sets, collaborate with leading scientists and government agencies, and contribute to real-world solutions for sustainable coastal management. We are looking for motivated students with a background in marine science, environmental science, quantitative ecology, or a related field. Experience with R, Python, or GIS is highly desirable, as is a passion for solving complex environmental problems through data-driven approaches.\n\n\nPhytoplankton on the move: tracking phytoplankton shifts in a changing climate\nPhytoplankton are the invisible powerhouses of the ocean—producing half of the world’s oxygen and forming the base of the marine food web. In a time of intensifying climate variability and change, understanding their response to stressors such as marine heatwaves, El Niño events, global warming and ocean acidification is critical. This PhD project will leverage nearly 20 years of Integrated Marine Observing System plankton data alongside historical records to examine how trends in phytoplankton abundance, timing, and species composition across Australia’s marine waters are being impact by climate variability and change. You will compare your findings on changes in zooplankton communities from Australia with a much larger global phytoplankton data set from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In this project, you will learn how to use advanced statistical techniques while developing expertise in climate-ecosystem interactions, ecological forecasting, and long-term environmental monitoring.\n\n\nSentinels of change: zooplankton response to a warmer and more acid ocean\nZooplankton, comprising around 40% of marine biomass, play a pivotal role in ocean ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. But how are these crucial organisms responding to climate variability and long-term change? This project will explore shifts in zooplankton abundance, distribution, composition and phenology using nearly 20 years of Integrated Marine Observing System data, with long-term context provided by historical Australian records. From the fingerprints of marine heatwaves and El Niño to the broader impacts of ocean warming and acidification, you will investigate whether zooplankton are extending their range southward, changing their seasonal behaviour, and showing signs of community change. You will be able to compare your findings on changes in zooplankton communities from Australia with a much larger global zooplankton data set from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Through this work, you will gain hands-on experience with large-scale ecological datasets and cutting-edge statistical modelling—essential tools for a future career in global change biology or marine ecosystem science.\n\n\nRise of the jellies? Unpacking the mystery of gelatinous zooplankton in a changing ocean\nAre jellyfish really taking over the oceans? Gelatinous zooplankton—including jellyfish, salps, and larvaceans—are increasingly recognized as key players in marine ecosystems. They influence food webs, carbon cycling, and even fisheries, yet their global trends remain contentious. Some evidence suggests they are proliferating in response to human pressures such as overfishing, warming seas, and pollution—but is this true? This project investigates long-term changes in gelatinous zooplankton at a global scale, combining ecological theory with cutting-edge data analysis. The student will update and analyse the global JeDI (Jellyfish Database Initiative) dataset and link it to environmental stressors, including Halpern’s human impact index. Using statistical models that account for sampling biases—such as generalized linear mixed models —the project will evaluate whether and where gelatinous taxa are increasing, and why. This project has the potential to shape marine policy and management. This is a great opportunity for a postgraduate student interested in global change biology and quantitative ecology, and who wants to gain valuable experience in global data synthesis and statistical modelling, while contributing to an urgent and unresolved scientific question. The project is co-supervised by experts at UQ and the Danish Technical University.\n\n\nShifting depths: Zooplankton behaviour in a warming ocean\nAs global temperatures rise and ocean productivity declines, one of the most fundamental behaviours in the marine food web—zooplankton diel vertical migration—may be undergoing a dramatic shift. This project asks a pressing question: in a warming ocean, will zooplankton reduce their daytime descents to the safety of deeper waters to feed for longer in surface waters and thus be more at risk of predation by visual predators such as fish? The outcomes have major implications for marine predator-prey dynamics and the biological carbon pump. Climate models and observations increasingly suggest that primary production from phytoplankton will decline, challenging zooplankton to find sufficient food while coping with the higher metabolic demands of warmer waters. By analysing long-term (&gt;60 yrs) global zooplankton datasets, this project will investigate if copepods are already altering their migration patterns, drawing parallels with other climate-driven behavioural changes in the animal kingdom—such as increased diurnal ibex foraging at night to escape heat, despite increased risk. The successful candidate will gain skills in big data analysis, ecological modelling, and climate-ecosystem interactions, contributing to a frontier area of marine science with wide-reaching ecological and biogeochemical consequences."

Phytoplankton produce half the oxygen on Earth and support marine food webs, while zooplankton transfer carbon to fish, whales, and seabirds, and drive key biogeochemical cycles.

Our lab develops dynamic ecosystem models that simulate life in the ocean—from bacteria to whales—based on core biological processes like feeding, growth, and predation. Central to our approach are size spectrum models, which track energy flow and carbon cycling across all body sizes and trophic levels.\nA major innovation in our work is resolving zooplankton, the critical but often overlooked link between phytoplankton and fish. Zooplankton not only sustain food webs but also drive the biological carbon pump—a process that draws carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in the deep sea. Yet most models simplify or omit their role.\nWe are advancing ZooMSS (Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra), a global, process-based model designed to better represent zooplankton diversity, temperature sensitivity, and carbon dynamics. By refining how zooplankton are modelled—including their impact on fisheries and carbon sequestration—we aim to answer key questions:\n\nHow will climate change alter zooplankton communities and their role in ocean carbon storage?\nHow does the temperature sensitivity of different zooplankton groups and processes alter carbon cycling in the ocean?\nWhy are there so many tuna in nutrient-poor tropical waters?\nWhat can improved zooplankton modelling tell us about future fish stocks and climate mitigation?\n\nZooMSS is an ecosystem model based on partial differential equations, is run on a supercomputer, and is the only global fisheries-ecosystem model that focuses on better representing zooplankton feeding relationships."

With the rise of the internet, having a personal website has become more critical than ever. A personal website serves as a platform to showcase your research work, achievements, and credentials to a global audience. It’s a professional tool that helps you stand out in a crowded digital world and reach a wider audience. In this tutorial, we will be exploring the steps involved in creating a personal website that accurately reflects your identity. From choosing the right tools all the way to publishing your website on the internet, this post will cover everything you need to know to create a successful and effective personal website. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you achieve your online goals and reach a new level of discoverability.\nThe internet is full of tools to build a website, and their sheer amount can be overwhelming. WordPress is a great no-code tool, but its visual editor has driven me nuts when I used it in the past to do client work as a freelance web designer. I personally prefer code-based tools because they give me full control and reproducibility. But even within the realm of code-based web design, there are more tools than a single person could ever try out.

Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.4.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.4.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.4.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive?

The template is called jolla, and you can find other options here. The id field assigns a name to the “About” section such that you can insert it anywhere in your page. As the name might suggest, the image field contains the path of an image to display on your landing page. Finally, the links field contains a bunch of social links. Each social entry consists of three fields:\n\nicon: identifier of an icon, such as twitter or envelope. You can take a look at the Standard Bootstrap5 Icons for more icon names.\ntext: description of the entry, usually for accessibility\nhref: link, make sure to add mailto: before an email address\n\nAs you can see in the /index.qmd file, the “About” block is inserted in the actual document via\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n::: {#about-block}\n:::\n\nand you can add a nice introduction about yourself below the block."

    "text": "3.1 Preparing your website for GitHub pages\nThe template already contains all necessary settings for GitHub pages, so you don’t have to do anything in this section. However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly straightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit the &lt;github username&gt;.github.io to Github, which includes the docs/ folder, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

    "text": "5.1 General web development tips\nHere are some general web development tips, ranging from file management and DNS over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n5.1.1 Relative links\nSuppose you are editing the file projects/index.qmd and want to add a link to the page &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography. You can of course link to the full URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend.\n\n\n5.1.4 Add favicon"

In addition, he have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.\nJason’s current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries."

    "text": "PhD Students\n\nSharad Bayyana\n\n\n\n\nSharad is a marine biologist who has joined the School of Environment as a PhD candidate. He comes from India, where he was engaged in several marine and wildlife research projects, after completing his master’s in marine biology. He also holds a post-graduate diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS. Back in India, he conducted research at the Wildlife Institute of India, in understanding the spatial ecology of Dugongs, mangroves succession in the Nicobar group of islands after the tsunami of 2004, and coral reef biodiversity assessment of Malvan Marine Sanctuary, along the west coast of India. He has previously worked at the Horniman Museum, London as a visiting researcher, to conduct research on coral reproductive biology and restoration practices. Lately, at Wildlife Conservation Society-India, he was involved in developing data-driven strategies for management practices of Marine Protected Areas along the west coast of India, before moving to Brisbane. For his PhD, he will pursue the implications of climate-driven risks on the biodiversity dynamics under the project “Portfolio projection of biodiversity responses under climate change”. The project aims to quantify adaptive and migration responses as vulnerability metrics, providing resource managers with novel tools to formulate flexible management strategies.\n\n\n\n\nDiego Bezerra\n\n\n\n\nDiego is an interdisciplinary marine ecologist interested in understanding the ecological mechanisms that drive ecosystem health. He foremost focuses on delivering scientific information to improve marine protected areas’ conservation outcomes. He is currently investigating elasmobranch migratory connectivity across reefs, and multispecies network models in conservation planning. He is also researching elasmobranch movement using network analysis as a tool to estimate population structures. Finally, his project aims to provide a baseline for shark migratory movement in Australia, strengthening understanding of connectivity within and beyond national jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\nKristine (Tin) Buenafe\n\n\n\n\nTin is a PhD candidate from the Philippines working on climate-smart marine conservation planning with a particular focus in the high seas. While she enjoys coding all-day, working to develop reproducible tools and frameworks used to facilitate the uptake of climate-smart approaches in on-the-ground, applied conservation planning approaches, she wishes to continue navigating the science-policy interface, particularly in relation to the Biodiveristy Beyond National Jursidiction (BBNJ) Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nEmer Cunningham\n\n\n\n\nEmer is a marine ecology student and researcher, who lives and works in her hometown of Magandjin (Brisbane). Emer acknowledges that this ‘home’ is unceded, sovereign Aboriginal Country, and is committed to learning more about the lands and waters that she cares about so deeply. Back in 2018, Emer started a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) at the University of Queensland – and she’s never left. Emer is in the final year of her PhD, investigating the patterns and drivers of ‘novel’ ecological states within coral reef ecosystems and pelagic plankton communities. Currently, Emer is working in the MME Lab researching ‘novelty’ in our changing climate – and helping to integrate this concept of rapid, unprecedented environmental change into marine spatial planning.\n\n\n\n\nAlvise Dabala\n\n\n\n\nAlvise is a PhD student at the Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab and the Applied Marine Biogeography Lab, supervised by Prof. Anthony Richardson and A/Prof. Daniel Dunn. His research focuses on developing climate-smart and connected spatial prioritisations for mangrove conservation to protect mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. He holds an Erasmus Mundus Master’s degree in tropical ecology (TROPIMUNDO). During his thesis, he developed a global study which identifies priority areas for mangrove conservation that maximise ecosystem services. Before starting his PhD at The University of Queensland, he joined the iAtlantic project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, developing spatial prioritisations for the conservation of the Atlantic Ocean at the University of Azores.\n\n\n\n\nAharon Fleury\n\n\n\n\nAharon Fleury completed his Master of Science Biology (Fisheries) program at University of Victoria, Canada in 2016 where he evaluated the reproductive ecology of hagfish off the coast of Vancouver Island. He has since worked five years as an environmental consultant performing ecological and human health risk assessments and modelling the movement of contaminants to humans, plants, and animals via biotic transport pathways. The aim of Aharon’s PhD research is to develop and apply a framework, built on an individual-based model, for environmental impact assessments of marine species that explicitly incorporates connectivity across a migratory cycle and facilitates decision-making by incorporating stakeholder values.\n\n\n\n\nYunzhe Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Moloney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra Neubert\n\n\n\n\nSandra is a marine data scientist with an interest in marine spatial planning and ecosystem modelling.
