    "text": "Conservation\n\nSeamount connectivity: informing deep-sea conservation with oceanographic models\nSeamounts—underwater mountains scattered throughout the ocean—are increasingly targeted by fisheries and may soon face pressure from seabed mining. Despite their ecological significance, most lie in the high seas, where protection is limited. The recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty provides a historic opportunity to advance conservation in these regions, but actionable science is urgently needed to guide spatial planning. This PhD project will explore how the connectivity of biodiversity among seamounts—driven by deep ocean currents —can inform the design of protected area networks. While direct observations of population connectivity in the deep sea are challenging, high-resolution oceanographic models offer new opportunities to simulate larval dispersal among seamounts. The student will simulate three-dimensional dispersal of neutrally buoyant particles from selected seamounts in key regions such as the western Pacific and central Pacific. These simulations will explore horizontal and vertical connectivity, identify potential source and sink regions, assess how oceanographic isolation may drive endemism, assess model predictions against available genetic data, and explore how oceanographic connectivity may support resilient fisheries. A key focus will be designing protected area networks that incorporate seamount connectivity. This PhD is suited to a student with interests in ocean modelling, marine conservation, and spatial ecology. It will involve working with large oceanographic datasets and particle tracking simulations, and will include collaborations with deep-sea ecologists, geneticists, and policy experts. The student will gain valuable skills in oceanographic modelling, systematic conservation planning, and deep-sea ecology, contributing directly to science-policy initiatives under the BBNJ Treaty.\n\n\nHow well do marine protected areas work? Tracking biodiversity in a changing ocean\nMarine protected areas are expanding rapidly around the world, but how well do they conserve biodiversity, especially under mounting human and climate pressures? This PhD project asks whether marine species fare better inside MPAs than outside, and whether stricter levels of protection lead to stronger ecological benefits. The student will leverage several global resources - including the BIOTIMEv2 database, IUCN red list status and AquaX distribution maps - and use Generalised Linear Mixed Models to assess how trends in species differ: inside and outside MPAs; with levels of protection in MPAs; with time since MPA designation; across taxonomic groups; with human stressors; with climate exposure; and across ecological traits. Are biodiversity trends more positive in highly protected areas or where more of a species range is covered by MPAs? Do MPAs buffer against climate change impacts such as ocean warming? Are larger species more vulnerable than small ones, and are certain habitats more affected than others? This project offers an exciting opportunity for a student with strong quantitative skills to work at the science-policy interface of marine conservation. You will develop expertise in large-scale biodiversity synthesis, statistical modelling, and conservation impact evaluation—key skills for careers in ecological research, marine policy, and environmental data science.\n\n\nSmart zoning for a sustainable ocean: Optimising protected areas for biodiversity and fisheries\nAlthough conservation scientists and NGOs advocate for fully protected no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), most MPAs end up as partial-take zones that permit some fishing—often without a clear strategy to maximise biodiversity outcomes. As global efforts accelerate to meet the 30x30 target—protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030—this disconnect between conservation ideals and real-world implementation risks delivering suboptimal outcomes for both nature and people. This PhD project asks: how can we better zone the global ocean to conserve biodiversity while supporting sustainable fisheries? It will explore whether zoning for one type of fishing (e.g., pelagic) can help protect other biodiversity components (e.g., benthic habitats), and whether more realistic, explicitly multi-use planning can outperform traditional no-take-only approaches. The project includes three integrated components: (1) a global synthesis of bycatch data across fishing gears to identify biodiversity most at risk; (2) an assessment of fishing activity within existing MPAs and its biodiversity impacts; and (3) a spatial optimisation analysis to design multi-use ocean zones that maximise both conservation and fisheries benefits. This is an excellent opportunity for a student interested in marine spatial planning, conservation science, and applied ecological modelling. The work will involve global datasets, advanced geospatial and statistical tools, and contribute directly to international policy efforts under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The student will gain expertise in systematic conservation planning, biodiversity data analysis, and policy-relevant science—valuable skills for careers in research, environmental policy, or global marine conservation.\n\n\nSafeguarding ocean biodiversity: Conserving species’ niches in marine protected areas\nMarine protected areas are central to ocean conservation, but how well do they protect the full diversity of environmental conditions that species need to adapt and persist? While many MPAs aim to cover habitat areas, surprisingly little is known about whether they capture the range of environmental conditions — the realized niches — that foster local adaptations and long-term species survival. This project will tackle this gap by assessing how well existing MPAs conserve environmental heterogeneity for marine species, inspired by cutting-edge approaches recently applied to terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Hanson et al. 2020, Nature). Using climate model outputs (Earth System Models) and species distribution data from AquaX, the student will classify key environmental features, including temperature, and evaluate how well marine protected areas meet conservation targets across these gradients. Ideal candidates will have skills in or a strong interest in learning spatial analysis, ecological modelling, marine conservation, climate change science, and working with large environmental data sets. This project offers the opportunity to work at the frontier of marine conservation science, develop advanced spatial analysis skills, and contribute solutions for designing future-proof protected areas that enhance the adaptive potential of species in a changing ocean.\n\n\nBlue carbon and biodiversity: Optimising marine protected areas for climate and conservation\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are powerful tools for conserving ocean biodiversity — but can they also help protect the ocean’s critical role in carbon sequestration? Recent research (e.g., Berzaghi et al. 2023, Nature Climate Change) highlights worrying overlaps between intensive fishing activities and key areas of pelagic and benthic carbon storage, threatening the ocean’s ability to draw down and store carbon. This project will explore how to design MPA networks that simultaneously protect biodiversity and safeguard carbon sequestration processes, aiming for win–win outcomes for conservation and climate mitigation. Using spatial data on fishing effort, carbon sequestration hotspots, and biodiversity patterns, the student will analyse trade-offs and synergies to inform smarter ocean protection strategies. This project offers the opportunity to develop expertise in marine spatial planning, carbon cycle science, and geospatial analysis, and contribute to urgently needed solutions at the intersection of biodiversity and climate action. Ideal candidates will have skills or a strong interest in spatial ecology, conservation planning, carbon cycle science, working with geospatial data, and/or ocean sustainability.\n\n\nProtecting Marine Biodiversity: Are We Covering Enough? (Honours or MSc project)\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a cornerstone of ocean conservation, but how well do they represent the full diversity of marine life? Most species have less than 5% of their ranges protected globally, and even less for wide-ranging and tropical ones (Klein et al. 2015). This project will assess how effectively current MPAs safeguard marine species, focusing on the critical “Representation” principle of the CARE (Connected, Adequate, Representative, Efficient) framework for MPA design. You will analyse species distribution maps (AquaX) to measure the percentage of species’ ranges covered by existing MPAs, distinguishing between those with partial and full protection. You will also evaluate how at-risk species, based on IUCN Red List status, are represented in fully protected areas. Looking ahead, you will project how climate change may alter the future effectiveness of MPAs. Through this project, you will gain expertise in spatial analysis, conservation planning, biodiversity informatics, and climate change impacts — skills that are highly sought after in marine science, government agencies, and conservation NGOs. Ideal candidates will have skills or a strong interest in marine ecology, spatial ecology and conservation.\n\n\nBiodiversity vs industry: Mapping the battle for ocean space (Honours or MSc)\nAs fishing, shipping, oil, gas, and mining activities accelerate in the ocean, protecting marine biodiversity is becoming increasingly complex. High overlap between biodiversity hotspots and human uses means greater threats to species — and higher costs when trying to establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This project will map where marine species distributions and human uses collide, and where they are distinct, providing critical insight into where conservation efforts can be most effective. Using AquaX global data for over 40,000 marine species, you will assess their overlap with spatial layers representing human use, including fishing, global shipping routes, oil/gas platforms and mining leases. You will also the degree of overlap between key biodiversity areas (such as Important Marine Mammal Areas, Bird Areas, and Shark and Ray Areas) and human uses. Analyses will explore different taxonomic groups, compare patterns inside Exclusive Economic Zones and in the high seas, and identify regions of both conflict and opportunity for marine protection. Through this project, you will build strong skills in spatial analysis, conservation planning, and data synthesis — valuable for careers in marine science, environmental consulting, NGOs, or government. We are looking for a motivated student with strong quantitative skills and a keen interest in conservation and marine spatial planning; experience with GIS or coding (e.g., R, Python) would be an advantage.\n\n\nSecuring Kelp Forests: Designing a Global Conservation Network for Ecosystem Services\nKelp forests are among the most valuable and productive ecosystems on Earth, generating an estimated US$500 billion per year in ecosystem services — from supplying food, materials, and potential biofuels, to removing nitrogen, sequestering carbon, protecting coastlines, and supporting rich biodiversity. Yet, despite their ecological and economic importance, global conservation planning rarely accounts for the full range of services kelp forests provide. This project will design a global Marine Protected Area (MPA) network for kelp forests. Working with global kelp biodiversity and ecosystem service datasets and using systematic conservation planning tools, you will identify priority areas that safeguard both kelp biodiversity and critical ecosystem services. The project will generate insights urgently needed for global conservation targets. You will develop skills in spatial analysis, ecosystem service valuation and conservation planning — preparing you for future roles in academia, conservation NGOs, or environmental policy. We are looking for a student who is passionate about marine conservation, with strong quantitative skills; experience with GIS, spatial modelling, or programming (e.g., R or Python) would be an advantage."

    "text": "Modelling\n\nThe role of zooplankton in the biological pump and impacts of climate change\nDespite their small size, zooplankton play a crucial role in the carbon cycle and marine food webs. However, current models struggle to accurately represent their contribution to the carbon transfer from the surface to deeper waters. This PhD project aims to improve our understanding of the role of zooplankton in the “biological pump,” which removes carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in the deep sea, how climate change could impact this process, and what this means for fisheries. This project will advance the development of the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra (ZooMSS), a global marine ecosystem model. With better zooplankton representation in ZooMSS - particularly realistic temperature responses of different zooplankton groups and processes - this will lead to improved understanding of the biological pump and why there is high tuna biomass in nutrient-poor tropical waters. This research will provide novel insights into marine ecosystems in a warming world and improve predictions of carbon sequestration and fish stocks, both important for managing climate change and fisheries. Students with a background in marine science or environmental modelling will gain expertise in ecosystem modelling, zooplankton ecology, and climate impact assessment.\n\n\nModelling zoolankton and fisheries to understand the global carbon cycles\nUnderstanding the role of zooplankton is arguably the biggest gap in our knowledge of the ocean carbon cycle. Zooplankton constitute 40% of total marine biomass, feed on different sizes of plankton, vary by an order of magnitude in their carbon content, and have diverse roles in carbon transport across the world’s oceans. Yet these features are poorly resolved in current ecosystem models.\nYou would develop new ways of modelling zooplankton in an innovative ecosystem model – the Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra (ZooMSS). You will use the model to explore present and future impacts of climate change on the global ocean’s capacity to sequester carbon and support fisheries. You would be working with a team of modellers, zooplankton ecologists, and climate change scientists.\nThis position is funded through the Australian Research Council Discovery Project Zooplankton: the missing link in modelling the ocean carbon cycle.\nThe scholarship includes: living stipend of $35,000 per annum tax free (2024 rate; indexed annually) and your tuition fees are covered.\nThis scholarship is available for Australian (or New Zealand) citizens and Australian permanent residents.\nYou will have demonstrated skills in modelling, coding experience (in any programming language), and strong written and communication skills. You do not need experience in marine ecology (although it is preferred), but you must have a keen interest to learn.\nMore information and how to apply for this position is available here\n\n\nSome like it hot: Rethinking models of zooplankton in a warming world\nDespite their pivotal role in oceanic carbon cycling, zooplankton are often oversimplified in marine ecosystem and biogeochemical models, where they are typically lumped into a few generic groups with uniform traits and temperature responses. This project challenges that paradigm by integrating the rich body of experimental data on zooplankton physiology to better represent their temperature preferences. We will quantify how different zooplankton groups vary in their temperature sensitivity—such as respiration, ingestion, growth, and faecal production—using group-specific Q10 values derived from meta-analyses of published data. These refined parameters will be incorporated into a next-generation ecosystem model to test how more realistic zooplankton dynamics affect predictions of fish biomass and carbon export under climate change. By comparing outputs from bespoke temperature parameterisations with traditional models using a uniform Q10, we aim to reveal how overlooked biological complexity can reshape our understanding of ocean futures. Students involved in this project will gain expertise in ecological modelling, meta-analysis, and climate-ecosystem interactions, contributing to a transformative shift in how zooplankton are represented in biogeochemical and ecosystem models. Ideal candidates will have a background in marine science, quantitative ecology, or biological oceanography, with strong skills in modelling and data analysis."

    "text": "Plankton\n\nTides of change: Unravelling long-term impacts of urbanisation on the ecosystem health of Moreton Bay\nAs Southeast Queensland continues to urbanise rapidly, the health of its iconic coastal ecosystems—especially Moreton Bay—is under increasing pressure. Urban expansion, evolving sewerage treatment practices, and intensifying flood events are altering the delicate balance of nutrient inputs and water quality. Yet, despite the ecological and economic importance of Moreton Bay, we still lack a clear, long-term understanding of how these stressors interact and impact ecosystem health over decades. This project leverages over 25 years of high-resolution data from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program (EHMP)—one of the world’s most comprehensive aquatic monitoring efforts. Using advanced statistical and modelling techniques, including integration with a ROMS biogeochemical model in the region, you will explore how urbanisation, wastewater management, and extreme weather events have shaped the ecological trajectory of Moreton Bay. The research will identify key drivers of change and inform future management strategies for resilient coastal ecosystems. As a student in this project, you’ll develop cutting-edge skills in time-series analysis, spatial modelling, and ecosystem forecasting. You’ll work with one of Australia’s richest environmental data sets, collaborate with leading scientists and government agencies, and contribute to real-world solutions for sustainable coastal management. We are looking for motivated students with a background in marine science, environmental science, quantitative ecology, or a related field. Experience with R, Python, or GIS is highly desirable, as is a passion for solving complex environmental problems through data-driven approaches.\n\n\nPhytoplankton on the move: tracking phytoplankton shifts in a changing climate\nPhytoplankton are the invisible powerhouses of the ocean—producing half of the world’s oxygen and forming the base of the marine food web. In a time of intensifying climate variability and change, understanding their response to stressors such as marine heatwaves, El Niño events, global warming and ocean acidification is critical. This PhD project will leverage nearly 20 years of Integrated Marine Observing System plankton data alongside historical records to examine how trends in phytoplankton abundance, timing, and species composition across Australia’s marine waters are being impact by climate variability and change. You will compare your findings on changes in zooplankton communities from Australia with a much larger global phytoplankton data set from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In this project, you will learn how to use advanced statistical techniques while developing expertise in climate-ecosystem interactions, ecological forecasting, and long-term environmental monitoring.\n\n\nSentinels of change: zooplankton response to a warmer and more acid ocean\nZooplankton, comprising around 40% of marine biomass, play a pivotal role in ocean ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. But how are these crucial organisms responding to climate variability and long-term change? This project will explore shifts in zooplankton abundance, distribution, composition and phenology using nearly 20 years of Integrated Marine Observing System data, with long-term context provided by historical Australian records. From the fingerprints of marine heatwaves and El Niño to the broader impacts of ocean warming and acidification, you will investigate whether zooplankton are extending their range southward, changing their seasonal behaviour, and showing signs of community change. You will be able to compare your findings on changes in zooplankton communities from Australia with a much larger global zooplankton data set from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Through this work, you will gain hands-on experience with large-scale ecological datasets and cutting-edge statistical modelling—essential tools for a future career in global change biology or marine ecosystem science.\n\n\nRise of the jellies? Unpacking the mystery of gelatinous zooplankton in a changing ocean\nAre jellyfish really taking over the oceans? Gelatinous zooplankton—including jellyfish, salps, and larvaceans—are increasingly recognized as key players in marine ecosystems. They influence food webs, carbon cycling, and even fisheries, yet their global trends remain contentious. Some evidence suggests they are proliferating in response to human pressures such as overfishing, warming seas, and pollution—but is this true? This project investigates long-term changes in gelatinous zooplankton at a global scale, combining ecological theory with cutting-edge data analysis. The student will update and analyse the global JeDI (Jellyfish Database Initiative) dataset and link it to environmental stressors, including Halpern’s human impact index. Using statistical models that account for sampling biases—such as generalized linear mixed models —the project will evaluate whether and where gelatinous taxa are increasing, and why. This project has the potential to shape marine policy and management. This is a great opportunity for a postgraduate student interested in global change biology and quantitative ecology, and who wants to gain valuable experience in global data synthesis and statistical modelling, while contributing to an urgent and unresolved scientific question. The project is co-supervised by experts at UQ and the Danish Technical University.\n\n\nShifting depths: Zooplankton behaviour in a warming ocean\nAs global temperatures rise and ocean productivity declines, one of the most fundamental behaviours in the marine food web—zooplankton diel vertical migration—may be undergoing a dramatic shift. This project asks a pressing question: in a warming ocean, will zooplankton reduce their daytime descents to the safety of deeper waters to feed for longer in surface waters and thus be more at risk of predation by visual predators such as fish? The outcomes have major implications for marine predator-prey dynamics and the biological carbon pump. Climate models and observations increasingly suggest that primary production from phytoplankton will decline, challenging zooplankton to find sufficient food while coping with the higher metabolic demands of warmer waters. By analysing long-term (&gt;60 yrs) global zooplankton datasets, this project will investigate if copepods are already altering their migration patterns, drawing parallels with other climate-driven behavioural changes in the animal kingdom—such as increased diurnal ibex foraging at night to escape heat, despite increased risk. The successful candidate will gain skills in big data analysis, ecological modelling, and climate-ecosystem interactions, contributing to a frontier area of marine science with wide-reaching ecological and biogeochemical consequences."

    "text": "As an academic researcher, scientist, or basically anyone working with a computer, it’s essential to have an online presence. With the rise of the internet, having a personal website has become more critical than ever. A personal website serves as a platform to showcase your research work, achievements, and credentials to a global audience. It’s a professional tool that helps you stand out in a crowded digital world and reach a wider audience. In this tutorial, we will be exploring the steps involved in creating a personal website that accurately reflects your identity. From choosing the right tools all the way to publishing your website on the internet, this post will cover everything you need to know to create a successful and effective personal website. Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this guide is designed to help you achieve your online goals and reach a new level of discoverability.\nThe internet is full of tools to build a website, and their sheer amount can be overwhelming. WordPress is a great no-code tool, but its visual editor has driven me nuts when I used it in the past to do client work as a freelance web designer. I personally prefer code-based tools because they give me full control and reproducibility. But even within the realm of code-based web design, there are more tools than a single person could ever try out. In this blog post, we will talk about how to set up your personal website with Quarto."

Let’s go through the _quarto.yml file step by step.\n\n2.4.1 Author info\nIt’s time to tell the readers about yourself. Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.4.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.4.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.4.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive? The official Quarto Documentation contains a bunch of other settings you can tweak via the _quarto.yml configuration. Happy hacking. Please submit a PR or raise an issue if you find something interesting that we all should know about."

Instead, we use one of the great template designs that are shipped with Quarto. Template inception.\nOpen the /index.qmd file and inspect the header, that is, the part at the top of the source code which is enclosed in --- delimiters:\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n---\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  id: about-block\n  image: img/my_image.png\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/WhoUsesTwitterAnymore\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/MathMarEcol\n    - icon: linkedin\n      text: LinkedIn\n      href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/WeDontHaveAnAccount\n    - icon: envelope\n      text: Email\n      href: \"mailto:a.richardson1@uq.edu.au\"\n---\n\nAll following fields are nested in the about field, which is our way of telling Quarto that all the subsequent information should be associated with our “About” section. The template is called jolla, and you can find other options here. The id field assigns a name to the “About” section such that you can insert it anywhere in your page. As the name might suggest, the image field contains the path of an image to display on your landing page. Finally, the links field contains a bunch of social links. Each social entry consists of three fields:\n\nicon: identifier of an icon, such as twitter or envelope. You can take a look at the Standard Bootstrap5 Icons for more icon names.\ntext: description of the entry, usually for accessibility\nhref: link, make sure to add mailto: before an email address\n\nAs you can see in the /index.qmd file, the “About” block is inserted in the actual document via\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n::: {#about-block}\n:::\n\nand you can add a nice introduction about yourself below the block."

Instead, you should go with /mypage/index.qmd and get the modern-looking URL www.yourname.com/mypage.\n!Avoid .html in your URL by using a subfolder with index.html.\nOnce you have created your brand-new index.qmd, just copy the code skeleton of any other index.qmd from the template and start adding your content.

    "text": "3.1 Preparing your website for GitHub pages\nThe template already contains all necessary settings for GitHub pages, so you don’t have to do anything in this section. However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly straightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit the &lt;github username&gt;.github.io to Github, which includes the docs/ folder, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

    "text": "5.1 General web development tips\nHere are some general web development tips, ranging from file management and DNS over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n5.1.1 Relative links\nSuppose you are editing the file projects/index.qmd and want to add a link to the page &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography. You can of course link to the full URL &lt;github username&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend.\n\n\n5.1.4 Add favicon"

All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” Ernest Hemingway\nWriting can be a lot of work!\n“If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter” Blaize Pascal, 1657\nWriting can invoke strong feelings!\n“Here is a lesson in creative writing. The first rule: do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you’ve been to college” Kurt Vonnegut, The Man Without a Country\nWriting can be fun!\n“To write is human, to edit is divine.” Stephen King\n\n\nMaybe a truthful but uninformative answer is “You know when you read it!”. Being able to understand the message easily is clearly essential. But so is being concise, as words cost journals money and scientists have limited time to read your work. But good scientific writing is more than just being clear and concise. For example, newspaper articles can be clear and concise, but most would say that the journalistic style is inappropriate in a scientific setting. Scientific writing has a host of conventions, not all of which are always made explicit. For example, adhering to the typical structure of a scientific paper, not using colloquialisms, not providing opinion, and not being emotive, to name a few. Although it might feel that such “rules” take the fun out of writing, good scientific writing should not be bland and boring to read. There is room, and indeed a need, for creativity.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why as scientists we need to write well. First, science is about ideas, and we need to communicate those ideas clearly, effectively and interestingly. An engaged reader will remember what s/he has read. If you fail to communicate effectively, your work will ultimately be of little use to the wider scientific community, resulting in lower uptake and fewer citations.\nSecond, publishing is the currency of science and requires convincing Editors and Reviewers that your work is robust and meaningful. If your work is not well written, you cannot expect others to understand it. Reviewers can become bogged down in poor writing and sometimes assume that it is indicative of poor science. Reviewers sometimes return poorly written manuscripts directly to the Editor and refuse to review it. At best poor scientific writing leads to delays in the publication process, and at worst outright rejection.\nThird, writing clearly will improve your science. If your supervisors, co-authors, and collaborators understand your message and see that you have worked hard to provide a clearly written piece of work, they will provide far better input. If collaborators have to rewrite your work to understand it before they can comment on the content, you will frustrate them immensely and you will receive fewer quality comments about scientific direction and whether your paper hits the mark. In fact, writing well is valued by many collaborators and will lead to more collaborations.\nLast, writing well is a fundamental scientific skill (along with, for example, knowledge of the scientific method, quantitative skills, and discipline-specific technical skills), and we have a responsibility to write as well as we can out of respect for others, and to pass this knowledge on. With escalating pressures on academics, fewer of them are taking the time to help students with their writing skills. In the worst cases, supervisors and collaborators to pass on the task of language editing to the peer-review process. This is hugely counterproductive, and simply reinforces the cycle of deterioration in writing skills. Students and the academics who supervise them need to take responsibility in being part of the solution – improving scientific writing by passing on their knowledge to others.\n\n\n\nWe all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work.\nThroughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students.\nWriting well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned."

    "text": "We all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work.\nThroughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students.\nWriting well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned."

An addendum to this rule is that ‘a’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a consonant. Similarly, ‘an’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a vowel.\nIt is worth noting that some writers use “a hypothesis” and others use “an hypothesis”. We prefer using “a hypotheisis”."

Lead (rhymes with bead) is a noun referring to an initiative or a position at the front.\nLead (rhymes with red) is also a noun referring to the metal.\n“The Australian programme is led by the University of Queensland, which is also the lead institution in the International Consortium of Lead Research Institutions.”\n\n\n4.23.4 ‘Lesser’ vs ‘Fewer’\n‘Lesser’ refers to quantity, whereas ’fewer refers to number.\n\n\n4.23.5 ‘Maybe’ vs ‘May be’\n“Maybe” is an adverb and refers to a choice. “Maybe” means “perhaps” when used as an adverb and denotes a choice. A simple trick of finding out if you have used “maybe” in the right place is by interchanging “maybe” with “perhaps.” The sentence should refer to a choice and make sense.\nRather than: The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but may be not neustonic.\nIt is: The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but maybe not neustonic.\nRather than: A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, may be because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.\nIt is: A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, maybe because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.\n“May be” is a verb and refers to a possibility. The way to check if “may be” is correct, is to substitute “could be” or “would be” in its place. If it makes sense, the usage is correct.\nRather than: It maybe difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.\nIt is: It may be difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.\nRather than: Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample maybe counted.\nIt is: Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample may be counted.\n\n\n4.23.6 ‘May’ vs ‘Might’ vs ‘Could’\nSome journals prefer ‘might’ rather than ‘may’ because ‘may’ can have a connotation of permission. ‘Could’ is often stronger than ‘may’ or ‘might’ and thus is preferable sometimes.\n\n\n4.23.7 ‘Past’ vs ‘Last’\nThere is not much difference, but careful writers prefer ‘past’. This is because ‘last’ can have the connotation of finality; there can be nothing after the last. It is thus preferable to use ‘past’ when referring to the period of time leading up to the present.\n\n\n4.23.8 ‘Practice’ vs ‘Practise’\n‘Practice’ is a noun referring to the application of an idea (‘the practice of science’), the exercise of a profession (‘he left scientific practice’), customary procedure (‘it was common practice’), or repeated exercise or performance (‘knowing his times table required a lot of practice’)\n‘Practise’ is a verb meaning to perform an activity or skill repeatedly to improve one's proficiency (‘He practised his dissection techniques’, or to observe or work at something (‘She practises science’)\nExample: You can practise your grammar at English Practice.\nNote that in US English, ‘practise’ is not used at all, only ‘practice’ for both meanings. If unsure, do what the Americans do and use practice!\n\n\n4.23.9 Predominate vs Predominant\nPredominate is a verb. Predominant is the adjective; as an adverb, predominantly (not \"predominately\").\nExample: Brown eye colour is the predominant trait\nExample: Brown eye colour predominates in humans.\n\n\n4.23.10 ‘Principle’ vs ‘Principal’\n‘Principle’ is always a noun and is a ‘basic truth’ or ‘rule’\n‘Principal’ can be an adjective or a noun. As an adjective it means ‘most important’. As a noun it means an “administrator” or “sum of money’. Note that when principal is used as a noun (e.g. principal of a school or the principal of a loan), it is the shortened form of a phrase (‘principal teacher’ or ‘principal sum’).\nHint: A useful way to remember which one to use is: “If you can substitute ‘main’ (which contains an ‘a’), use principal (which also contains an ‘a’). If you can substitute ‘rule’ (which ends in ‘le’), use principle (which also ends in ‘le’) (William and Mary Morris, Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage. Harper & Row, 1975).\n“The principal reason that allometry is a scientific principle is principally that size governs the physiological, biological and ecological processes of plants and animals.”\n\n\n4.23.11 Should vs Could\nStating something “should” be done, rather than “could” be done, can be interpreted as too prescriptive and even a bit arrogant. It is usually better to say “could”.\nRather than: Further studies should investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site.\nTry: Further studies could investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site\n\n\n4.23.12 ‘Toward’ vs ‘Towards’\nThese are interchangeable. US and Canadian writers ‘towards’ and British and other English writers prefer ‘towards’. The same is true for ‘backwards/fowards’ and ‘backward/forward’ when used as adverb in the UK and US respectively. But when used as an adverb ‘Something is backward compatible’ or ‘She is forward- looking’, then it never has an ‘s’.\n\n\n4.23.13 ‘Where’ vs ‘When’\nThink about whether the sentence is talking about space or time. For example:\nRather than: “Where M. birostris were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”\nTry: “When M. birostris were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”\n\n\n4.23.14 ‘Which’ vs ‘That’\nDistinguishing these two words can help to make intended relationships unmistakable, which is important in reporting scientific information. If the clause can be omitted without leaving the modified noun incomplete, use which and enclose the clause within commas or parentheses; otherwise, use that.\nCareful users of English distinguish the two. A ‘that’ should be used before a restrictive clause and ‘which’ before a non-restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is one that defines the situation and cannot be removed. A non-restrictive clause is separated by commas and is an additional piece of information that can be removed from the sentence without altering the meaning.\nFor example, which of the following is correct:\n“Chickens that are well fed produce many eggs” “Chickens, which are well fed, produce many eggs” “Chickens which are well fed produce many eggs”\nThe 1st one is correct, because only chickens that are well fed will produce many eggs. In the 2nd sentence, removing the ‘which are well fed’ separated by commas, leaves us with a sentence ‘Chickens produce many eggs’ that has a different meaning to the first sentence and is untrue (chickens produce no eggs when they are starving). In the 3rd sentence, it is better to replace the ‘which’ with ‘that’, as a clause with ‘which’ should be separated by commas and it is not then the restrictive clause that is needed here. Here is another example:\n“Copepods that are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” “Copepods, which are the world’s most abundant metazoans, are ubiquitous.” “Copepods which are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” Here the 2nd one is correct. The ‘which are the world’s most abundant metazoans’ is a non-restrictive clause, and removing this clause does not change the meaning of the sentence ‘Copepods are ubiquitous’.\nAlthough this might seem to be splitting hairs (or setae in the case of copepods!), it helps the Reader more easily follow your writing."

    "section": "4.24 Punctuation",
    "text": "4.24 Punctuation\n\n4.24.1 Apostrophes\nApostrophes are used to show the omission of a letter or letters in a contraction, and to indicate possession. The possessive case causes the most problems. The following guidelines apply:\n\nSingular nouns are made possessive by adding an apostrophe and an ‘s’ at the end of them, even if they end in an ‘s’ or ‘ss’:\n\nThe manta’s feeding area (the feeding area belongs to the manta) The student’s thesis (the thesis belongs to the student)\nThe pus’s colour (the colour belongs to the pus)\nThe moss’s growth (the growth belongs to the moss)\n\nPlural nouns (e.g. multiple animals) that end in ‘s’ (which is most plurals) are made possessive by adding an apostrophe without an ‘s’:\n\nThe mantas’ feeding area (the feeding area belongs to multiple mantas).\nThe fishes’ tank (the tank belongs to the fish)\nThe students' theses (the theses belong to the students)\n\nPlural nouns that do not end in ‘s’ are made possessive by adding an apostrophe with an ‘s’:\n\nThe people’s conference (the conference belonging to the people) The sheep’s brains (the brains belonging to the sheep)\n\nThere is an exception to #1. If the singular and plural of a noun both end in an ‘s’, the possessive for both is then formed by adding an apostrophe only:\n\nThe species’ status is endangered (the status belonging to species)\nRabies’ cases were increasing (the cases belonging to rabies)\nIn the case of a noun where both forms end in an ‘s’, it may be necessary to reword the sentence to clarify whether you are referring to a singular or plural noun:\nThe status of the species was endangered. The status of the two species was endangered.\n\nWhen two or more nouns possess the same thing, add apostrophe ‘s’ to the last noun:\n\nSmith and Pauly’s paper (Smith and Pauly worked together on the same paper)\n\nWhen two or more nouns separately possess something, add apostrophe ‘s’ to each noun:\n\nSmith's and Pauly’s papers (Each person has their own paper)\n\nDo Not Use an Apostrophe with Possessive Pronouns. Possessive pronouns already show ownership (e.g. yours, his, hers, theirs). However, we do add an apostrophe ‘s’ to form the possessive of some indefinite pronouns (e.g. anybody's guess, one's personal responsibility, somebody's breakthrough)\nDo not use an apostrophe when the word desired is a plura. For example, it shodul be 1980s, not 1980’s.\n\n\n\n4.24.2 Recommendations\nApostrophes can be a bit of a minefield, and are often avoided in scientific writing. Here are some recommendations.\n\n4.24.2.1 Minimize contractions.\nContractions are used frequently in informal writing, but are rare in scientific writing\nRather than: Isn’t\nTry: Is not\nRather than: There’s\nTry: There is\n\n\n4.24.2.2 Minimize apostrophes for possessives.\nRather than: The manta’s underside is blotched\nTry: The underside of the manta is blotched\n\n\n4.24.2.3 Never use an apostrophe to form a plural.\nUse an ‘s’ without an apostrophe to form plurals of nouns, including dates, acronyms, and family names (it is not possessive)\nRather than: The mid-1980’s\nTry: The mid-1980s\nRather than: Ecosystem Based Model’s (EBM’s) are common\nTry: Ecosystem Based Models (EBMs) are common\n\n\n4.24.2.4 “It’s” vs ”Its”. These are often confused.”It’s” is common in colloquial writing and can be replaced by “it is” in scientific writing. “Its” is a personal pronoun.\nRather than: It’s difficult to calculate its value\nTry: It is difficult to calculate its value\n\n\n\n4.24.3 Commas\nCommas make your writing more readable and sometimes are essential for correct meaning. A comma is used to break up two clauses where a pause is needed between them. The pause can be used to introduce a new idea or to separate items in a list. A comma often helps to separate clauses that being with “but” or “with”, and at pauses at start of sentences, say after “Similarly,”.\nThe following sentence is more readable with a comma after “reproduction”.\nRather than: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.\nTry: While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.\nSimilarly, a comma after “live weight” makes the following sentence clearer.\nWithout the comma after “live weight”, you have to read the first sentence multiple times to understand its meaning.\nRather than: As data were expressed in terms of live weight conversion factors were used again to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.\nTry: As data were expressed in terms of live weight, conversion factors were used to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.\nOften a comma is needed for clarity in a list when there are multiple “ands”. In the following, the comma after “flows” makes the list much easier to read.\nRather than: The tidal range, flood and ebb flows and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.\nTry: The tidal range, flood and ebb flows, and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.\nSometimes the meaning of a sentence can be changed entirely depending on if and where a comma is used.\nVersion 1: While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for Irukandji it appears to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested but appears to be reliable for Irukandji)\nVersion 2: While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for the Irukandji Carukia barnesi, it does appear to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested for Irukandji, but it appears reliable for other species)\nAnd one last example to illustrate that you can get yourself into real trouble with the (mis)-use of commas. This appeared in the Times, intended as a description of a Peter Ustinov documentary:\nHmmm: Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.\nDo not omit commas before conjunctions in compound sentences.\n\n\n4.24.4 Spaces\nHistorically writers have used two spaces after a fullstop, but now the norm is to use one space. This is the standard in scientific journals. It also makes your work a bit shorter, which is always good. You can search for two spaces and replace with one space once ready to submit.\nMost journals use a space between numbers and units. Usually journals do not leave a space between the number and units of °C, %, °N, °S, °E, °W.\n\n\n4.24.5 Hyphens\nHyphening of compound or unit modifiers is often needed to clarify what is modifying what. For example, a small-grain harvest (harvest of small grain) is different from a small grain harvest (small harvest of all grain). A man eating fish is different from a man-eating fish!

    "text": "4.25 Short and simple sentences\nThere is a tendency in scientific writing to have long, complex sentences, making it difficult for the Reader to follow. Your work will be cited more if you use shorter and more understandable sentences. If you need to have a long sentence, follow it with a short sentence to give the Reader a rest.\nOne way of assessing how convoluted your writing is, is to use a Fog Index. Gunnings’s Fog Index is the best known and measures the level of reading difficulty of any document. It is an estimate of the education grade/year that a Reader would need to understand your work. It can be calculated at http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html.\nGunning’s Fog Index = [(average number of words per sentence) + (number of words of 3 syllables or more)] × 0.4\nThe Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain all have Fog Indexes of about 6. Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average about 11. Scientific writing has higher Fog Indexes because of the nature of the content, but it is worth calculating yours for different pieces of work and try to reduce it. If your Fog Index soars then you might lose your readers in the fog!\nMicrosoft Word calculates two other indexes for you. The Flesch Reading Ease Test is on a 100-point scale, with the higher the score the easier it is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test rates text on a U.S. school grade level, similar to the Gunnings Fog Index, with a score of 7 meaning that a seventh grader can understand it. You can calculate these directly in your Word documents. In Windows, under Word ‘Options’, click ‘Proofing’, select ‘Check grammar with spelling’, and under ‘When correcting grammar in Word’ select ‘Show readability statistics check box’. For a Mac, go to Word ‘Preferences’, select ‘Spelling and Grammar’, and check ‘Show readability statistics’. When you then go through and use Tools Spelling and Grammar, Word will give you scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test.\n\n4.25.1 Can you say something more simply? Make explicit statements\nMany scientists are reluctant to state facts explicitly, constantly couching expressions in vague terms. Maybe the logic is that if you are not making definitive statements then you can never be wrong. However, this means you end up saying very little, and what you do say confuses rather than informs. Remember words cost money for a journal (in terms of space) so be concise. A key skill in science is to be clear what we know and state those explicitly, and what we suspect/think and couch those more carefully. Many times, explicit statements are much clearer.\nRather than: Some reef fish are known to farm algae, which shifts the benthos from a bare surface to an algal covered benthos.\nTry: Some reef fish farm algae, which shifts the seafloor from a bare surface to one covered by algae.\nRather than: These organisms may require mechanisms of motility to access nutrients and preferred environmental conditions.\nTry: These organisms are motile so they can access nutrients and their preferred environmental conditions.\nRather than: The possibility of vertical adjustment of species as a response to climate change has been shown at a large-scale for fish and invertebrate species in various parts of the ocean.\nTry: Fish and invertebrates can move deeper as oceans warm.\nIn the next example, did the researchers “aim to investigate” the problem, or did they actually “investigate” the problem?\nRather than: Here we aimed to investigate the interaction between whale shark feeding ecology and characteristics of the zooplankton community.\nTry: Here we investigated the relationship between whale shark feeding ecology and the zooplankton community.\nRather than: There is very little difference of the impact of the different scenarios on evenness.\nTry: Different scenarios have similar evenness.\nRather than: Targeted fisheries at aggregation sites can considerably affect population abundance of a species and can rapidly lead to local depletion.\nTry: Targeted fisheries at aggregation sites can deplete local populations.\nRather than: There is strong evidence that trophic level has been shown to increase continuously with body size in plankton, benthic invertebrates and pelagic fish communities.\nTry: Trophic level increases with body size in plankton, benthic invertebrates and pelagic fish.\nRather than: Climate velocity and connectivity tailored to capture the rates and directions of change in climate matching temporal windows of biological processes or life stages can therefore provide critically meaningful information for conservation.\nTry: Climate velocity and connectivity tailored to match temporal windows of biological processes or life stages can therefore provide meaningful information for conservation.\nAn additional way to make your writing more concise is to remove ‘the’ before plurals.\nRather than: The samples were collected…\nTry: Samples were collected…\nRather than: Thermal niche tracking in marine species was shown in a previous study by Poloczanska et al., (2013) where from a meta-database (Marine Climate Change Impacts Database) containing 1,735 marine species’ responses, species exhibiting a shift typically moved at a rate consistent with sea-surface temperature changes.\nTry: Based on a meta-database containing 1,735 marine species’ responses, Poloczanska et al., (2013) showed that species tracked their thermal niche, moving at a rate consistent with sea surface temperature changes.\n\n\n4.25.2 Uncertainties – only one in a sentence\nMultiple uncertainties in a sentence weaken your message and waste words.\nRather than: It is possible that this optimum temperature may be too high for albacore in our region.\nTry: It is possible that this optimum temperature is too high for albacore in our region.\nBest: This optimum temperature could be too warm for albacore in our region.\nRather than: We suggest that the majority of dietary intake for this species may be of mesopelagic origin.\nTry: We suggest that the majority of dietary intake for this species is of mesopelagic origin.\nRather than: Reduction of residence time may suggest reduced viability of a protected area.\nTry: Reduction of residence time suggests reduced viability of a protected area.\n\n\n4.25.3 Removing redundancy in sentences\nSentences can often be made clearer and shorter by removing redundant and superfluous words. In the following sentence, the last clause “but this remains undemonstrated” is redundant, as it is implied by the third clause “has been hypothesized to cause illness”.\nRather than: One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of Carybdea xaymacana, has been hypothesised to cause illness, but this remains undemonstrated.\nTry: One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of Carybdea xaymacana, has been hypothesised to cause illness.\nIn the following example, there is no need to give coordinates when you refer to a map in a figure.\nRather than: The region was subsetted into five discrete 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). The five regions included the north- south latitudinal gradient with the following coordinates; region 1, 20°S to 25°S, 20°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 2, 25°S to 30°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 3, 30°S to 35°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 4, 35°S to 40°S, 152.5°E to 157.5°E; and region 5, 40°S to 45°S, 150°E to 155°E.\nTry: The region was subsetted into five 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1).\nIn the next example, it is best not to refer back to previous sections of your work (e.g., as described/discussed/mentioned above, as described/discussed/mentioned previously), because it is vague, as you know exactly where, but your Readers do not. You should either assume people have read it or be more explicit about what you are referring to. The same goes for referring to something below.\nRather than: As numerical techniques and accuracy evolved, models showed that kelp distribution was correlated with many of the other variables discussed above.\nTry: As numerical techniques and accuracy evolved, models showed that kelp distribution was correlated with X, Y and Z. Remove sentences that do not say much.\nSometimes sentences do not say much and thus confuse the Reader and muddle your message. The examples below say very little and they are\nThese are throw statements that you do not learn much from.\nMeaning? Although they concluded that further knowledge is needed regarding food web organization, …\nIf 83% of the ocean is warming then this implies ocean temperatures are changing.\nRather than: Approximately 83% of the area of the global ocean has warmed over the past half century (Burrows et al., 2011), as ocean temperatures change worldwide (Durack et al., 2014).\nTry: Approximately 83% of the area of the global ocean has warmed over the past half century (Burrows et al., 2011, Durack et al., 2014)."

    "section": "4.26 Effective sentences",
    "text": "4.26 Effective sentences\nSentences are the building blocks of any written piece. Knowing how to write well means getting your sentences right.\n\n4.26.1 Agreement of subject and verb\nSingular subjects need singular verbs and plural subjects need plural verbs. This can be tricky when the subject is not immediately next to the verb, as in the following. In the following two examples, the subject of the sentence is singular (‘information’ and ‘number’) and not plural (‘parameters’ or ‘analyses’), so a singular verb (‘is’) is needed.\nRather than: Information on basic biological parameters are essential.\nIt is: Information on basic biological parameters is essential.\nRather than: A number of supplementary analyses were conducted.\nIt is: A number of supplementary analyses was conducted\nHere is one final example of a singular subject (‘distance’) needing a singular verb (‘is’).\nRather than: The distance shifted at the leading and trailing edges are less prominent.\nIt is: The distance shifted at the leading and trailing edges is less prominent\nAnd here is an example where the subject of the sentence is plural (‘distances’) and not singular (‘edge’), so a plural verb (‘are’) is needed.\nRather than: Distances shifted at the leading and trailing edge is less prominent.\nIt is: Distances shifted at the leading and trailing edge are less prominent.\n\n\n4.26.2 Putting like things together\nSimilar points should be closer together in a sentence or you risk. Here mercury and lead are not tissues but trace elements, so should go near trace elements.\nRather than: Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements in their tissues such as mercury and lead.\nTry: Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements such as mercury and lead in their tissues\n\n\n4.26.3 Active vs Passive voice\nThere are two voices in English – active and passive. The active voice is often more direct, clearer and vivid, and is preferred for scientific writing and giving instructions. However, the passive voice is preferred when the subject of the sentence is implied, indefinite, general, unimportant, or if the writer is trying to increase vagueness or suspense. The passive voice often uses the word ‘by’ and is usually longer. The active voice often used personal pronouns (I, We, His, Her, Us). Historically, it has been frowned upon to use personal pronouns in scientific writing, perhaps because science should be independent of personal biases and detached from the researchers themselves. We are often taught in our undergraduate studies that using personal pronouns in scientific writing is anathema and many traditional scientists still reject it.\nIn more recent years, however, there has been a push toward using the active rather than the passive voice in scientific writing because it is more direct and shorter. Our advice is to write in the active voice and use personal pronouns wherever you need to. Occasionally you will get an Editor who might not like it, but this is increasingly rare. If you do strike an Editor who does not like it, change it. Microsoft Word will highlight passive sentences and help you change them.\nExamples of passive vs active voice follow. Which voice do you prefer?\n##Passive:## Gravity was discovered by Galileo. Here ‘Gravity’ is the subject, ‘Galileo’ is the object and ‘was discovered by’ is the verb.\n##Active:## Galileo discovered gravity. Here ‘Galileo’ is the subject of the sentence, ‘gravity’ is the object and ‘discovered’ is the verb\n##Passive 1:## An ecosystem model was constructed by us. Here ‘an ecosystem model’ is the subject, ‘us’ is the object, and ‘was constructed by’ is the verb.\n##Passive 2:## An ecosystem model was constructed. As above, but the object “us” is implied.\n##Active:## We constructed an ecosystem model. Here ‘We’ is the subject, ‘an ecosystem model’ is the object, and ‘constructed’ is the verb.\n##Rather than##: Photosynthesis is regulated by light and nutrients.\nTry: Light and nutrients regulate photosynthesis.\n\n\n4.26.4 Logical sequence\nIt is usually best to use a logical sequence in a sentence, wherever possible. For example, in time (e.g., February before March), space (e.g., describe sites from North to South), phylogenetically (e.g., from simple to complex), or importance (e.g., human stresses on ecosystems that are most to least harmful). When this is not possible, alphabetical order is a good option.\nIn the next example, transposing ‘weekly and daily’ makes more sense, as the sentence now goes from hourly, through daily, to weekly.\nRather than: Hourly data were used for the case studies, while weekly and daily means were calculated for time-series analyses.\nTry: Hourly data were used for the case studies, while daily and weekly means were calculated for time-series analyses.\n\n\n4.26.5 Numbers in sentences\nThe general rule of writing numbers is that you spell out numbers less than 10 and write as a number those 10 or greater. There are a few extensions to this though.\nNever write numbers before units.\nRather than: five m.s-1\nIt is: 5 m.s-1\nWhen there are several numbers in a sentence and some are smaller and some are larger than 10, it is clearer for Readers to write them all as numbers.\nRather than: The three lionesses had 10 cubs.\nTry: The 3 lionesses had 10 cubs.\nSome writers do not like starting a sentence with a number and prefer to spell it out, but it is usually neater to rewrite the sentence.\nRather than: 50 samples were collected.\nTry: A total of 50 samples were collected.\n\n\n4.26.6 One idea per sentence\nOne idea per sentence makes it easier to follow, although two ideas can be linked if they are short and simple.\nRather than: Occurring in all of the world’s oceans, diatoms are primarily comprised of rigid silica walls and are the first taxa to rapidly increase their abundance, or “bloom” following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters.\nTry: Diatoms have rigid silica walls and are found in all oceans. Diatoms are the first taxa to rapidly increase in abundance (“bloom”) following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters.\n\n\n4.26.7 Lists in a sentence\nA standard way to have a list in a sentence is to start it with a colon, have semicolons between the items, and to use an ‘and’ after the last semicolon. It can be with or without numbers.\nExample: Assuming these trends in ocean warming are continued in the future, we hypothesise that: (1) pelagic fish species leading edges would shift further than their trailing edges; (2) shifts would be greater in winter than summer; and (3) shallower species would shift further south than deeper species."

    "text": "4.27 Effective paragraphs\n\n4.27.1 Structure\nTopic sentence and concluding sentences in paragraphs – not appropriate in fictional writing.\nThe 1st sentence of a paragraph should summarize the paragraph. Thus if you want to skim a paper, you should be able to read the 1st sentence of each paragraph and follow the logic of the paper. This means that when writing a paragraph, keep in mind that it should give the overall message of the paragraph.\nParagraphs should also not be too long. The longer the paragraph, the more difficult it is for the Reader to follow the message, and the more likely the Writer is to meander. Short, punchy paragraphs will best convey your messages.\nHere it is useful to separate the single long paragraph into two shorter paragraphs so the Reader does not get the impression that you are saying the same thing twice – it emphasises that one analysis is for Biomass and the other one is for Abundance.\nRather than: Zooplankton biomass was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F(2,87)=11.41, p=3.98x10-5; Figure 4a). There was no significant difference in zooplankton biomass when manta rays were not feeding or were absent. Zooplankton was also significantly more abundant during feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F2,47=11.48, p=8.69x10-5; Figure 4b). There was no significant difference in manta ray abundance when manta rays were not feeding or were absent.\nTry: Biomass of zooplankton (Figure 4a) was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding (9.33 mg m-3, n=12; or were absent (ANOVA F(2,87)=11.41, p=3.98x10-5).

There was no significant difference in manta ray abundance when manta rays were not feeding or were absent\n\n\n4.27.2 Lists\nThe use of lists highlights a difference between writing in novels and scientific/technical writing. In a novel, there are never boring, repetitive lists that would lose Readers’ interest. In scientific and technical writing, however, lists are often vital for helping the Reader follow a complex argument or know all the different causes. Only use lists when there are three or more items: two items can just be explained one after the other and the Reader can easily follow. Lists are normally introduced with a sentence that states there are few/several/many explanations/reasons/steps for something.\nRather than: Firstly, … Secondly, … Thirdly\nTry: Firstly, … Secondly, … Lastly\nOr best: First, … Second, … Last"

Our lab develops dynamic ecosystem models that simulate life in the ocean—from bacteria to whales—based on core biological processes like feeding, growth, and predation. Central to our approach are size spectrum models, which track energy flow and carbon cycling across all body sizes and trophic levels.\nA major innovation in our work is resolving zooplankton, the critical but often overlooked link between phytoplankton and fish. Zooplankton not only sustain food webs but also drive the biological carbon pump—a process that draws carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in the deep sea. Yet most models simplify or omit their role.\nWe are advancing ZooMSS (Zooplankton Model of Size Spectra), a global, process-based model designed to better represent zooplankton diversity, temperature sensitivity, and carbon dynamics. By refining how zooplankton are modelled—including their impact on fisheries and carbon sequestration—we aim to answer key questions:\n\nHow will climate change alter zooplankton communities and their role in ocean carbon storage?\nHow does the temperature sensitivity of different zooplankton groups and processes alter carbon cycling in the ocean?\nWhy are there so many tuna in nutrient-poor tropical waters?\nWhat can improved zooplankton modelling tell us about future fish stocks and climate mitigation?\n\nZooMSS is an ecosystem model based on partial differential equations, is run on a supercomputer, and is the only global fisheries-ecosystem model that focuses on better representing zooplankton feeding relationships."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Much of this tutorial comes from Hadley Wickham and Jenny Byran’s book - R Packages: Organise, Test Document and Share your Code which is open access! Highly recommended to read!\n\n1 create_package()\n\nCall create_package() to initialize a new package in a directory on your computer (and create the directory, if necessary).\nMake a deliberate choice about where to create this package on your computer. It should probably be somewhere within your home directory, alongside your other R projects. It should not be nested inside another RStudio Project, R package, or Git repo. Nor should it be in an R package library, which holds packages that have already been built and installed. The conversion of the source package we create here into an installed package is part of what devtools facilitates. Don’t try to do devtools’ job for it!\n\n# Create the basic skeleton of your package\n# create_package(\"package_name\")\nusethis::create_package(\"~/GitHub/splanning\")\n\nIf you’re working in RStudio, you should find yourself in a new instance of RStudio, opened into your new planningunits package (and Project). RStudio has special handling for packages and you should now see a Build tab in the same pane as Environment and History.\n\n\n.Rbuildignore lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source.\n\n.Rproj.user, if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio.\n\n.gitignore anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio. Even if you do not plan to use Git, this is harmless.\n\nDESCRIPTION provides [metadata about your package]. We edit this shortly.\n[NAMESPACE] declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At this point, it is empty, except for a comment declaring that this is a file we will not edit by hand.\nThe R/ directory is the [“business end” of your package]. It will soon contain .R files with function definitions.\n\nplanningunits.Rproj is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project. Even if you don’t use RStudio, this file is harmless. Or you can suppress its creation with create_package(..., rstudio = FALSE).\n\n2 use_git()\n\nThe use of Git or another version control system is optional, but a recommended practice in the long-term.\nThe planningunits directory is an R source package and an RStudio Project. Now we make it also a Git repository, with use_git().\n\nusethis::use_git()\n\nWhat’s new?\nOnly the creation of a .git directory, which is hidden in most contexts, including the RStudio file browser. Its existence is evidence that we have indeed initialized a Git repo here.\nIf you’re using RStudio, it probably requested permission to relaunch itself in this Project, which you should do. Now, in addition to package development support, you have access to a basic Git client in the Git tab of the Environment/History/Build pane.\n\n3 Write the first function\nBefore we start building a package, you would normally have a good idea of what you want to include. Or maybe you already have a bunch of functions that you think will be useful to be bundled as a package.\nWithin the MME lab, we do a lot of spatial planning work with our students. This necessitates the creation of equal area planning units (a grid of hexagons) that we use for solving our planning problems. Each planning unit is allocated to be either within a reserve, or not. Wouldn’t it be easier for all our students if we had a function that created the planning units for them?\nLets have a go.\nFirst I have some code as a script.\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\nCellArea &lt;- 100000\nRegion = \"South Atlantic Ocean\"\n\ncCRS &lt;- \"+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs\" \ndiameter &lt;- 2 * sqrt((CellArea*1e6)/((3*sqrt(3)/2))) * sqrt(3)/2 # Diameter in m's\n\nBndry &lt;- ne_download(scale = \"medium\", category = \"physical\", type = \"geography_marine_polys\", returnclass = \"sf\") %&gt;% \n  filter(name %in% Region) %&gt;%   # Filter out ocean_list from ocean_sf\n  select(name, ne_id, geometry) %&gt;% \n  st_transform(cCRS)\n\n# First create planning units for the whole region\nPUs &lt;- st_make_grid(Bndry,\n                    square = FALSE,\n                    cellsize = c(diameter, diameter),\n                    what = \"polygons\") %&gt;%\n  st_sf() %&gt;% \n  filter(st_centroid(.) %&gt;%\n           st_intersects(Bndry) %&gt;%\n           lengths &gt; 0) # Get logical vector instead of sparse geometry binary\n\nLets check the code works by plotting the output.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", type = \"countries\", returnclass = \"sf\") %&gt;% \n  filter(continent == \"South America\" | continent == \"Africa\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = world, aes(fill = name), show.legend = FALSE) + \n  geom_sf(data = PUs)\n\nThis code is likely to be reused multiple times so I should turn it into a function. The first thing I need to do is put the function call at the top, and decide on the inputs. Then I will add all the package calls and remove the library calls (except magrittr at the moment).\nRead R4DS for more information about writing functions.\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nCellArea &lt;- 100000\nRegion = \"South Atlantic Ocean\"\n\n\nGet_PlanningUnits &lt;- function(Region, CellArea){\n\n  cCRS &lt;- \"+proj=robin +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs\" \n  diameter &lt;- 2 * sqrt((CellArea*1e6)/((3*sqrt(3)/2))) * sqrt(3)/2 # Diameter in m's\n  \n  Bndry &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_download(scale = \"medium\", category = \"physical\", type = \"geography_marine_polys\", returnclass = \"sf\") %&gt;% \n    dplyr::filter(name %in% Region) %&gt;%   # Filter out ocean_list from ocean_sf\n    dplyr::select(name, ne_id, geometry) %&gt;% \n    sf::st_transform(cCRS)\n  \n  # First create planning units for the whole region\n  PUs &lt;- sf::st_make_grid(Bndry,\n                          square = FALSE,\n                          cellsize = c(diameter, diameter),\n                          what = \"polygons\") %&gt;%\n    sf::st_sf() %&gt;% \n    dplyr::filter(sf::st_centroid(.) %&gt;%\n                    sf::st_intersects(Bndry) %&gt;%\n                    lengths &gt; 0) # Get logical vector instead of sparse geometry binary\n}\n\n\nCellArea &lt;- 100000\nRegion = \"South Atlantic Ocean\"\nPUs &lt;- Get_PlanningUnits(Region, CellArea)\n\nNow we have our first function for the package. What do we do with it?\n\n4 use_r()\n\nSave it in a .R file, in the R/ subdirectory of your package. A reasonable starting position is to make a new .R file for each user-facing function in your package and name the file after the function. As you add more functions, you’ll want to relax this and begin to group related functions together. We’ll save the definition of Get_PlanningUnits() in the file R/Get_PlanningUnits.R.\nThe helper use_r() creates and/or opens a script below R/. It really shines in a more mature package, when navigating between .R files and the associated test file. But, even here, it’s useful to keep yourself from getting too carried away while working in Untitled4.\n\nusethis::use_r(\"Get_PlanningUnits\")\n\nPut the definition of Get_PlanningUnits() and only the definition of Get_PlanningUnits() in R/Get_PlanningUnits.R and save it. The file R/Get_PlanningUnits.R should NOT contain any of the other top-level code we have recently executed, such as the definition of our practice input such as CellArea &lt;- 1000000, Region = \"South Atlantic Ocean\", library(magrittr) devtools::use_r(), or devtools::use_git(). This foreshadows an adjustment you’ll need to make as you transition from writing R scripts to R packages. Packages and scripts use different mechanisms to declare their dependency on other packages and to store example or test code.\n\n5 use_pipe()\n\nIf you recall, we said we would deal with magrittr later. We will need to first import the pipe from magrittr so we can use it in our package. Again, usethis comes to the rescue with an easy to use function.\n\n# Importing pipe from magrittr\nusethis::use_pipe()\n\n# The document functions updates NAMESPACE so we can use the pipe in our first function\ndevtools::document()\n# Look at NAMESPACE\n\n\n6 use_package()\n\nYou will inevitably want to use a function from another package in your own package. Just as we needed to export Get_PlanningUnits(), we need to import functions from the namespace of other packages. If you plan to submit a package to CRAN, note that this even applies to functions in packages that you think of as “always available”, such as stats::median() or utils::head().\nIf we look back at our function, we can see we are using 3 packages\n\nusethis::use_package(\"dplyr\")\nusethis::use_package(\"rnaturalearth\")\nusethis::use_package(\"sf\")\n\nThis code adds these 3 packages to the “Imports” section of DESCRIPTION. And that is all it does.\n\n7 load_all()\n\nBefore we start playing with our package, lets restart R to ensure we have a clean slate. Go to the menu bar and click Session -&gt; Restart R. It is really good practice to do this regularily when youa re coding!\nHow do we test drive Get_PlanningUnits()? If this were a regular R script, we might use RStudio to send the function definition to the R Console and define Get_PlanningUnits() in the global environment. Or maybe we’d call source(\"R/Get_PlanningUnits.R\"). For package development, however, devtools offers a more robust approach.\nCall load_all() to make Get_PlanningUnits() available for experimentation.\n\ndevtools::load_all()\n\nNow call Get_PlanningUnits() to see how it works.\n\nCellArea &lt;- 100000\nRegion = \"South Atlantic Ocean\"\nPUs &lt;- Get_PlanningUnits(Region, CellArea)\n\nNote that load_all() has made the Get_PlanningUnits() function available, although it does not exist in the global environment.\nload_all() simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the splanning package. As your package accumulates more functions, some exported, some not, some of which call each other, some of which call functions from packages you depend on, load_all() gives you a much more accurate sense of how the package is developing than test driving functions defined in the global environment. Also load_all() allows much faster iteration than actually building, installing, and attaching the package.\nReview so far:\n\nWe wrote our first function, Get_PlanningUnits.\nWe used load_all() to quickly make this function available for interactive use, as if we’d built and installed splanning and attached it via library(splanning).\n\n8 check()\n\nWe have informal, empirical evidence that Get_PlanningUnits() works. But how can we be sure that all the moving parts of the regexcite package still work? This may seem silly to check, after such a small addition, but it’s good to establish the habit of checking this often.\nR CMD check, executed in the shell, is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order. check() is a convenient way to run this without leaving your R session.\nNote that check() produces rather voluminous output, optimized for interactive consumption. We intercept that here and just reveal a summary. Your local check() output will be different.\n\ndevtools::check()\n\nRead the output of the check! Deal with problems early and often. It’s just like incremental development of .R and .Rmd files. The longer you go between full checks that everything works, the harder it becomes to pinpoint and solve your problems.\n\n9 use_mit_license()\n\n\nPick a License, Any License. – Jeff Atwood\n\nLet’s call use_mit_license().\n\nusethis::use_mit_license()\n\nThis configures the License field correctly for the MIT license, which promises to name the copyright holders and year in a LICENSE file.\nLike other license helpers, use_mit_license() also puts a copy of the full license in LICENSE.md and adds this file to .Rbuildignore. It’s considered a best practice to include a full license in your package’s source, such as on GitHub.\n\n10 Edit DESCRIPTION\n\nThe DESCRIPTION file provides metadata about your package and is covered fully in chapter @ref(description). This is a good time to have a look at regexcite’s current DESCRIPTION. You’ll see it’s populated with boilerplate content, which needs to be replaced.\nMake these edits:\n\nMake yourself the author. If you don’t have an ORCID, you can omit the comment = ... portion.\nWrite some descriptive text in the Title and Description fields.\n\n11 document()\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to get help on Get_PlanningUnits(), just like we do with other R functions? This requires that your package have a special R documentation file, man/Get_PlanningUnits.Rd, written in an R-specific markup language that is sort of like LaTeX. Luckily we don’t necessarily have to author that directly.\nWe write a specially formatted comment right above Get_PlanningUnits(), in its source file, and then let a package called roxygen2 handle the creation of man/Get_PlanningUnits.Rd. The motivation and mechanics of roxygen2 are covered in chapter @ref(man).\nIf you use RStudio, open R/Get_PlanningUnits.R in the source editor and put the cursor somewhere in the Get_PlanningUnits() function definition. Now do Code &gt; Insert roxygen skeleton. A very special comment should appear above your function, in which each line begins with #'. RStudio only inserts a barebones template, so you will need to edit it.\nBut we’re not done yet! We still need to trigger the conversion of this new roxygen comment into man/Get_PlanningUnits.Rd with document():\n\ndevtools::document()\n\nYou should now be able to preview your help file like so:\n\n?Get_PlanningUnits\n\n\n12 check()\n\nsplanning should pass R CMD check cleanly now and forever more: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes.\n\ndevtools::check()\n\n\n13 install()\n\nSince we have a minimum viable product now, let’s install the splanning package into your library via install():\n\ndevtools::install()\n\nNow we can attach and use splanning like any other package.\nLet’s revisit our small example from the top. This is a good time to restart your R session and ensure you have a clean workspace.\n\nlibrary(splanning)\n\nCellArea &lt;- 100000\nRegion = \"South Atlantic Ocean\"\nPUs &lt;- Get_PlanningUnits(Region, CellArea)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nworld &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", type = \"countries\", returnclass = \"sf\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(continent == \"South America\" | continent == \"Africa\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = world, aes(fill = name), show.legend = FALSE) + \n  geom_sf(data = PUs)\n\nSuccess!\n\n14 use_readme_rmd()\n\nNow that your package is on GitHub, the README.md file matters. It is the package’s home page and welcome mat, at least until you decide to give it a website (see pkgdown), add a vignette (see chapter @ref(vignettes)), or submit it to CRAN (see chapter @ref(release)).\nThe use_readme_rmd() function initializes a basic, executable README.Rmd ready for you to edit:\n\nusethis::use_readme_rmd()\n\nIn addition to creating README.Rmd, this adds some lines to .Rbuildignore, and creates a Git pre-commit hook to help you keep README.Rmd and README.md in sync.\nREADME.Rmd already has sections that prompt you to:\n\nDescribe the purpose of the package.\nProvide installation instructions. If a GitHub remote is detected when use_readme_rmd() is called, this section is pre-filled with instructions on how to install from GitHub.\nShow a bit of usage.\n\nHow to populate this skeleton? Copy stuff liberally from DESCRIPTION and any formal and informal tests or examples you have. Anything is better than nothing. Otherwise … do you expect people to install your package and comb through individual help files to figure out how to use it? They probably won’t.\nWe like to write the README in R Markdown, so it can feature actual usage. The inclusion of live code also makes it less likely that your README grows stale and out-of-sync with your actual package.\nIf RStudio has not already done so, open README.Rmd for editing. Make sure it shows some usage of Get_PlanningUnits().\nDon’t forget to render it to make README.md! The pre-commit hook should remind you if you try to commit README.Rmd, but not README.md, and also when README.md appears to be out-of-date.\nThe very best way to render README.Rmd is with build_readme(), because it takes care to render with the most current version of your package, i.e. it installs a temporary copy from the current source.\n\ndevtools::build_readme()\n\n\n15 use_data\n\nIt makes sense to include data that your package relies on. This could include example datasets (think mtcars).\n\nBndry &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_download(scale = \"medium\", category = \"physical\", type = \"geography_marine_polys\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nusethis::use_data(Bndry)\n\n\n16 use_badges\n\nThere are many badges you can use in your markdown and website which indicates the status of your project.\n\nusethis::use_lifecycle_badge(\"experimental\")\n\nFunctions that configure continuous integration, such as use_github_actions(), also create badges.\n\n17 use_vignette()\n\nTo create your first vignette, run:\n\nusethis::use_vignette(\"my-vignette\")\n\nThis will:\n\nCreate a vignettes/ directory.\nAdd the necessary dependencies to DESCRIPTION (i.e. it adds knitr to the Suggests and VignetteBuilder fields).\nDraft a vignette, vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd.\n\nThe draft vignette has been designed to remind you of the important parts of an R Markdown file. It serves as a useful reference when you’re creating a new vignette.\nOnce you have this file, the workflow is straightforward:\n\nModify the vignette.\nPress Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K (or click Knit) to knit the vignette and preview the output.\n\nYou can build all vignettes from the console with devtools::build_vignettes(), but this is rarely useful. Instead use devtools::build() to create a package bundle with the vignettes included.\nThere are three important components to an R Markdown vignette:\n\nThe initial metadata block.\nMarkdown for formatting text.\nKnitr for intermingling text, code and results.\n\n18 pkgdown\n\nRun once to configure your package to use pkgdown\n\nusethis::use_pkgdown()\n\nThen use pkgdown to build your website:\n\npkgdown::build_site()\n\nThis generates a docs/ directory containing a website. Your README.md becomes the homepage, documentation in man/ generates a function reference, and vignettes will be rendered into articles/. Read vignette(“pkgdown”) for more details, and to learn how to deploy your site to GitHub pages.\n\n19 Cleanup\n\npkgload::unload(\"splanning\") # Unload\nremove.packages(\"splanning\") # Delete installed version from your computer"

In addition, he have extensive experience working with satellite data and numerical model output.\nJason’s current research focus is to quantify how the size, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and fish change across local, regional and global scales. By quantifying the size-based ecosystem through modelling and observations, we can better understand processes such as metabolism, predation or movement, which constrain the role of an individual in its food web. In particular, the biomass and size distribution of zooplankton is poorly understood relative to phytoplankton and fish in our oceans, yet it is critical to understanding the efficiency of energy transfer through to fisheries."

He comes from India, where he was engaged in several marine and wildlife research projects, after completing his master’s in marine biology. He also holds a post-graduate diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS. Back in India, he conducted research at the Wildlife Institute of India, in understanding the spatial ecology of Dugongs, mangroves succession in the Nicobar group of islands after the tsunami of 2004, and coral reef biodiversity assessment of Malvan Marine Sanctuary, along the west coast of India. He has previously worked at the Horniman Museum, London as a visiting researcher, to conduct research on coral reproductive biology and restoration practices. Lately, at Wildlife Conservation Society-India, he was involved in developing data-driven strategies for management practices of Marine Protected Areas along the west coast of India, before moving to Brisbane. For his PhD, he will pursue the implications of climate-driven risks on the biodiversity dynamics under the project “Portfolio projection of biodiversity responses under climate change”. The project aims to quantify adaptive and migration responses as vulnerability metrics, providing resource managers with novel tools to formulate flexible management strategies.\n\n\n\n\nDiego Bezerra\n\n\n\n\nDiego is an interdisciplinary marine ecologist interested in understanding the ecological mechanisms that drive ecosystem health. He foremost focuses on delivering scientific information to improve marine protected areas’ conservation outcomes. He is currently investigating elasmobranch migratory connectivity across reefs, and multispecies network models in conservation planning. He is also researching elasmobranch movement using network analysis as a tool to estimate population structures. Finally, his project aims to provide a baseline for shark migratory movement in Australia, strengthening understanding of connectivity within and beyond national jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\nKristine (Tin) Buenafe\n\n\n\n\nTin is a PhD candidate from the Philippines working on climate-smart marine conservation planning with a particular focus in the high seas. While she enjoys coding all-day, working to develop reproducible tools and frameworks used to facilitate the uptake of climate-smart approaches in on-the-ground, applied conservation planning approaches, she wishes to continue navigating the science-policy interface, particularly in relation to the Biodiveristy Beyond National Jursidiction (BBNJ) Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nEmer Cunningham\n\n\n\n\nEmer is a marine ecology student and researcher, who lives and works in her hometown of Magandjin (Brisbane).
